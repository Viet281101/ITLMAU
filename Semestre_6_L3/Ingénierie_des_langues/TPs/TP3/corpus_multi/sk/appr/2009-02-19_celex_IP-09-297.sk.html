V Bruseli 19. februára 2009Hodnotiaca tabuľka vnútorného
trhu/výročné správy o sieti SOLVIT a o NSO:
Členské štáty pokračujú vo vysokej miere
implementácie, treba však vykonať viac v oblasti praktického
uplatňovania predpisovPodľa najnovšej hodnotiacej tabuľky
vnútorného trhu Európskej komisie
pokračujú členské štáty v dosahovaní
dobrých výsledkov pri implementácii dohodnutých pravidiel
vnútorného trhu do vnútroštátnych právnych
predpisov. V priemere len 1,0 % smerníc o vnútornom trhu,
ktorých termín implementácie uplynul, nie je
v súčasnosti transponovaných
do vnútroštátnych právnych predpisov. Znamená to,
že väčšina členských štátov aj
naďalej spĺňa nový cieľ vo výške 1,0 %, na
ktorom sa dohodli hlavy štátov.   Sedemnásť
členských štátov splnilo cieľ, pričom Dánsko
spolu s Maltou dosiahli najlepšie výsledky. Celkovo 14
členských štátov dosiahlo alebo zopakovalo svoje doteraz
najlepšie výsledky. Nie je to však všetko. Táto
hodnotiaca tabuľka obsahuje dosiahnutú úroveň
hospodárskej integrácie, z ktorej vyplýva, že ak sa
odstránia existujúce prekážky, získa sa
značný priestor na ďalšiu integráciu, a analýzu
toho, do akej miery uplatňujú členské štáty
pravidlá vnútorného trhu v praxi.  Situácia v tejto oblasti
je menej uspokojivá: z údajov vyplýva, že priemerné
množstvo prípadov nesprávneho uplatňovania sa
zvýšilo na 49 na jeden členský štát a že
riešenie týchto prípadov je príliš zdĺhavé. Z
výročných správ o SOLVIT a o Navigačnej službe pre
občanov (NSO) vyplýva, že občania a podniky sa s
riešením svojich problémov na vnútornom trhu obracajú
čoraz viac na služby EÚ v oblasti poradenstva a riešenia
problémov, než aby využívali formálne postupy
podávania sťažností. 
Tieto tri správy – hodnotiaca tabuľka, SOLVIT a NSO –
boli teraz vydané v rámci jedného balíka, ktorý
zdôrazňuje úzku súvislosť medzi implementáciou
právnych predpisov a praktickým riešením problémov na
vnútornom trhu.
Implementácia smerníc o vnútornom trhuV prípade 27 členských štátov dosahuje
priemerný deficit v transpozícii, čiže podiel smerníc z
oblasti vnútorného trhu, ktoré sa včas netransponovali do
vnútroštátnych právnych predpisov, úroveň
1,0 %, čo je zase hodnota nového cieľa, ktorý by sa
mal dosiahnuť do roku 2009. Stále to však znamená, že
92 smerníc z oblasti vnútorného trhu nebolo
transponovaných do vnútroštátnych právnych predpisov v
určenom čase. Medzi týchto 92 smerníc patrí 22
smerníc, ktorých lehota na transpozíciu vypršala už
pred viac ako 2 rokmi.
14 členských štátov dosiahlo alebo zopakovalo svoj
najlepší výsledok: Dánsko, Malta, Slovinsko, Holandsko,
Rumunsko, Slovensko, Lotyšsko, Maďarsko, Fínsko, Francúzsko,
Rakúsko, Írsko, Česká republika a Portugalsko.
Dánsko a Malta (0,3 %) sa delia o prvé mesto,
pričom ich od dosiahnutia nulového deficitu delí iba 5
smerníc.
Česká republika dosiahla znížením deficitu o
1,1 % na 1,4 % najvýraznejší pokrok.
Cyprus, Grécko, Portugalsko, Poľsko a Luxembursko naproti
tomu nedosiahli cieľ na úrovni 1,5 %. 
Deficit Luxemburska a deficit Poľska je na úrovni
dvojnásobku priemerného transpozičného deficitu EÚ.
Porušovanie predpisovTaliansko a Španielsko majú najviac otvorených
prípadov porušovania predpisov. Taliansko však dosiahlo
najväčšie zníženie počtu otvorených postupov
vo veci porušenia predpisov (15), po ňom nasledujú
Francúzsko (9), Španielsko a Malta (5). V
Belgicku a na Slovensku sa naproti tomu počet
otvorených prípadov zvýšil so 14 a 11 novými konaniami
v prípade porušenia predpisov.  
Z piatich členských štátov, ktoré pri
transpozícii dosahujú z hľadiska dodržiavania
lehôt najhoršie výsledky (Cyprus, Grécko, Portugalsko,
Poľsko a Luxembursko), sa v troch (Grécko, Portugalsko,
Poľsko) zvýšil aj počet konaní v prípade
porušenia právnych predpisov. Nová kapitola
hodnotiacej tabuľky týkajúca sa hospodárskej integrácie
vnútorného trhu dokazuje, že rozširovanie sa dá
považovať za významnú hnaciu silu ďalšej
integrácie v rámci vnútorného trhu, keďže
väčšina členských štátov patriacich k
EÚ-10 je veľmi otvorená dovozom a priamym investíciám z
iných členských štátov.  Obchodovanie s tovarom vo
vnútri EÚ je v rámci všetkých členských
štátoch oveľa viac rozvinuté (v roku 2007 predstavovalo 16,9
% HDP) ako obchodovanie so službami vo vnútri EÚ (5 % HDP), z
čoho vyplýva, že existujú značné možnosti
ďalšej integrácie.  
SOLVIT a NSO pomáhajú aj naďalej tisícom
Európanov
Počet prípadov siete SOLVIT sa v roku 2008 zvýšil o
ďalších 22 % na 1 000, zatiaľ čo
úspešnosť ich riešenia zostala vysoká na úrovni
83 %. Riešenie prípadov trvalo priemerne len dva mesiace.
Úspory nákladov občanov a podnikov v dôsledku
vyriešenia problémov prostredníctvom siete SOLVIT sa v roku 2008
odhadli na 32,6 milióna EUR (platí to pre 25 % všetkých
vyriešených prípadov a vychádza sa pritom z nákladov,
ktoré by vznikli v prípade, že sa problém
nevyrieši).
Navigačná služba pre občanov (NSO), ktorá poskytuje
občanom bezplatné individuálne právne poradenstvo a
„navigáciu“ týkajúcu sa ďalšej pomoci,
odpovedala počas roka 2008 na približne 11 000 žiadostí
o informácie a v značne viac ako 90 % prípadoch bola
doručená odpoveď do troch pracovných dní.  
Analýza žiadostí o informácie doručených NSO a
prípadov siete SOLVIT poskytuje priamy obraz ťažkostí
občanov a podnikov a prispieva k určovaniu problémov, ktoré
by bolo ešte treba vyriešiť, aby sa zlepšilo fungovanie
vnútorného trhu.  
V roku 2008 bolo obom službám doručené veľké
množstvo žiadostí týkajúcich sa oblastí
sociálneho zabezpečenia, odbornej kvalifikácie a
voľného pohybu osôb. Taktiež je zjavné, že
neskorá transpozícia alebo neúčinné uplatňovanie
niektorých predpisov v oblasti vnútorného trhu spravidla vedie k
zvýšeniu množstva prípadov predložených týmto
službám, napr. v oblastiach práva na pobyt a odbornej
kvalifikácie.

Consumer rights
Question: A British citizen residing in another EU country is
overcharged by the national telecom operator who failed to inform him that they
had changed the supplier, and asks about redress. 
Reply: He is informed of the relevant EU legislation, namely of
Council Directive 93/13 on unfair terms in contracts and his rights under this
legislation, and advised to consult the local European Consumer Centre and other
private consumer organisations in case the telecom operator does not consider
his complaint.
The citizen later wrote to express his satisfaction with the answer
provided by CSS: “Through your help we have been able to recover
429€ from our telecom operator”.
Travel rights for non-EU spouses
Question: A British citizen wants to travel to another EU country,
where she has a family house, with her non-EU husband but is encountering
difficulties in obtaining a visa for him. The authorities of the host country
charge an administration fee and insist that the husband provides proof of his
employment together with an invitation from both the citizen and her mother (who
is co-owner of the family house) to stay there. They are requested to fill in
forms even though it is clearly stated that particular questions need not be
answered by the spouses of EU citizens. The British citizen seeks for
advice.
Reply: She is informed that her husband should be granted a visa free
of charge and without undue formality by the national authorities. It should not
be necessary for him to provide proof of employment or an invitation, nor should
he have to pay an administration fee. The requirements of the national
authorities seem to go beyond the requirements of EU law. The citizen is advised
to contact the relevant authorities. 
The citizen wrote back to thank CSS for its advice, which allowed the
spouse of the British citizen to travel without undue formalities.
Social security
Question: A Polish citizen working in Austria for 12 years asks if he
can get Austrian family benefits even if his wife and four children live in
Poland, where she is registered with the unemployment office. 
Reply: He is informed that the European rules provide that, as a
resident in the territory of another Member State, he is subject to the same
obligations and enjoys the same benefits under the legislation of that State as
its nationals, and that he could claim the right to certain social security
benefits granted by Austrian social security scheme, even if his family members
lived in another Member State. 
The citizen wrote back saying that the CSS advice eventually enabled him
to get family benefits in Austria.

SELECTION OF SOLVIT SUCCESS STORIES IN 2008
FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS
Procuring a permanent work permit in Germany for a Czech citizen
A Czech citizen who had been working in Germany for more than one year
applied for a permanent work permit. However, the German authorities were
reluctant to issue a work permit that would be valid for more than one year.
SOLVIT pointed out that, under the Accession Treaty, the person was entitled to
a permanent work permit and convinced the authorities to issue the document.
Solved within 2 weeks.
SOCIAL SECURITY[  ]Italian citizen gets unjustified fee cancelled in FranceAn
Italian citizen worked for two months in France in Euro Disney. She needed
urgent medical assistance and was operated on in a public hospital. Afterwards
she was asked to pay EUR 12 494.46 for the assistance received, despite the
fact that this cost should have been covered by the insurance. Thanks to
SOLVIT's intervention, the error was corrected and the invoice was sent to the
insurance company. Solved within 5 weeks.British citizen receives his pension from Portugal
A British citizen worked in Portugal as a teacher for a couple of years and
each month contributed about 10% of his salary to the Portuguese Pension Scheme.
When he retired, he returned to the United Kingdom and applied for payment of
his pension. Having tried unsuccessfully for over four years to receive his
pension, he turned to a Member of the European Parliament for assistance. The
MEP contacted SOLVIT and, very quickly, the applicant not only received his
backdated pension but was also assured that his monthly pension would be paid on
a regular basis. 
Solved within 14 weeks.
Problems with birth allowance clarified in Belgium
A Belgian citizen living in Belgium had a husband who was living in
Luxembourg. Their child was born in Belgium and she received a birth allowance
from the Belgian authorities. After the birth, she went to live with her husband
in Luxembourg. As a result, the Belgian authorities claimed repayment of the
birth allowance, arguing that family benefits should be paid by Luxembourg.
However, Luxembourg did not want to pay either. SOLVIT made it clear that it was
up to the Belgian authorities to pay this birth allowance, since the baby had
been born in Belgium, and it convinced the Belgian authorities that they were
not entitled to claim the money back. 
Solved within 6 weeks.
Ensures unemployment benefits for Czech citizen returning from IrelandA Czech citizen, who worked in Ireland for more than one year, decided to
return to the Czech Republic. Before she left Ireland, she applied there for a
document setting out her entitlements to unemployment benefit. Five months after
her application, she turned to SOLVIT for help. The form was issued immediately
after SOLVIT's intervention. 
Solved within one week.
SOLVIT solves cross-border pension problem
A Hungarian citizen applied for a widow's pension from the German authorities
since her late husband had worked in Germany for most of his working life.
However, seven months after her application, she had still heard nothing from
the German authorities. SOLVIT discovered that the delay was due to the
provisions of an old German law that recognised pension rights to foreigners
only if they were living in Germany. SOLVIT intervened to point out that this
practice was not in line with EU law and with the principle of free movement of
workers. Following this intervention, the German competent authority recognised
the widow's pension rights. 
Solved within one week.
Greek citizen does not have to pay double social security
contributions
A Greek engineer, working as a self-employed person in Greece, expanded his
activities into Belgium. Since in Belgium he was also working as a self-employed
person, he presented the appropriate E101 forms to the Belgian authorities,
explaining that he was covered by the Greek social security scheme. However, as
he had registered himself and his family in a Belgian commune and had a Belgian
VAT number, the Belgian authorities considered him to be permanently resident in
Belgium and asked him to pay social security contributions for his past 4 years
of activity in Belgium, which amounted to EUR 22.000. Following the intervention
of SOLVIT Belgium, the Belgian authorities agreed to reconsider the case and
recognised Greece as the client's main place of residence. 
Solved within 13 weeks.
Swedish student registered with an Italian municipality
A Swedish citizen, currently studying in Italy, experienced some difficulties
in trying to register with the Italian municipality where she resided because it
did not accept her European Health Insurance Card as proof of her health
insurance cover in Sweden. The student was informed that she might be prevented
from completing her studies unless she obtained an Italian insurance. SOLVIT
contacted the municipality and cleared up the misunderstanding. The student had
been registered and did not have to take out complementary insurance as
initially demanded by the Italian authorities. 
Solved within 9 weeks.
SOLVIT helps Czech citizen obtain an E 104 form from Denmark
A Czech citizen worked in Denmark for six months. When he returned to the
Czech Republic, the Health Insurance Company informed him that he had to pay
health insurance contributions for the period of six months during which he had
been abroad, unless he could produce an E 104 form completed by the Danish
Authority. Although the Danish Authority provided the client with a document
showing the detailed tax records, this was not acceptable to the Czech Health
Insurance Company, which insisted on receiving the E 104 form. Thanks to SOLVIT
DK, the E 104 form was issued within a few days. 
Solved within 3 weeks.
SOLVIT helps an Estonian bus driver to get a good night’s
sleep
An Estonian bus driver, who had worked and lived in Finland for 5 years,
needed medical help for sleeping disorders related to his occupation. However,
although he was covered by Finnish health insurance, he was refused treatment in
the Finnish hospital on the argument that he was no longer under the Finnish
social security system. With the help of the Finnish SOLVIT centre, the problem
was cleared up and the client was able to receive the treatment to which he was
entitled. 
Solved within 11 weeks.
SOLVIT arranges payment of medical invoices sent to holidaymakers
In two separate instances, an Italian and an Austrian citizen were on holiday
in the Netherlands when they had to have urgent medical treatment. They showed
their European Health Insurance Cards and were treated. After returning home,
they received invoices from the Netherlands, and were expected to pay for the
medical service. Solvit contacted the hospitals and the invoices were redirected
to the national contact points, which ensured that payment was duly processed.Solved within 5 weeks.
REGULATED PROFESSIONS[  ]Hungarian diploma recognised in FranceA French citizen with a
Hungarian nursing diploma applied for recognition of her professional
qualifications in France so that she could take up employment. However, the
competent authority did not react within the six-month deadline laid down by EU
law. This delay was jeopardising her chances of accepting the job she had been
offered. Thanks to SOLVIT's intervention, the committee responsible for the
decision assessed her file and proceeded swiftly to fully recognise her
qualifications. Solved within 9 weeks.Qualifications of the Belgian teacher recognized in Portugal
A Belgian teacher with a diploma in Physical Education, Sports and Leisure
Activities, residing in Portugal, wanted the Portuguese authorities to recognize
his professional diploma. He had been trying to get an answer to his application
since 2001, but it was not until recently (7 years after his initial request!)
that the competent authority informed him that his application had been
rejected. SOLVIT Portugal persuaded the Portuguese competent authority to
reconsider his file and grant the professional recognition of his Belgian
diploma in accordance with EU law. 
Solved within 7 weeks.
SOLVIT helps Polish doctor in Spain
A Polish citizen applied for recognition of her medical qualifications in
Spain. Even though according to EU law the procedure for examining an
application must be completed as quickly as possible, and in any event within 3
months of the submission of a complete file, the citizen had been waiting over
four months for the recognition. Thanks to the intervention of SOLVIT, the
Spanish authorities eventually assessed the applicant's qualifications. 
Solved within 9 weeks.
British nurse obtains recognition of her qualifications in France
A fully qualified British nurse moved to France but was unable to obtain
recognition of her professional qualifications because her documentation
referred to a recently adopted EU law, which had not yet been implemented in
France. She was thus unable to support herself or to begin her new life in
France. Following SOLVIT's intervention, the French regional authority
acknowledged its obligation to accept applications under the new EU legislation
and the nurse's application was accepted immediately. 
Solved within 4 weeks.[  ]SOLVIT makes sure Romanian physiotherapists can sit exam in
ItalyFive Romanian citizens wanted to have their physiotherapist
qualifications recognised in Italy. The Italian competent authority assessed
their files and asked them to choose a compensation measure, i.e. either a
training period or an exam. Although the citizens informed the authority of
their choice, the Ministry failed to organise the exam, thereby obliging the
citizens to wait. Thanks to SOLVIT's intervention, the Ministry agreed to
organise the exam. All five physiotherapists passed and had their qualifications
recognised. Solved within 4 weeks.SOLVIT helps Portuguese entrepreneurs to start a business in
Luxembourg
Three Portuguese citizens working in Luxembourg as employees of a company
dealing with construction and public works wanted to establish their own company
in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg authorities required them to present an official
document certifying their professional experience. After several unsuccessful
attempts to obtain the requisite document from the Portuguese authorities, they
decided to contact SOLVIT Portugal, who persuaded the relevant authority to
provide the papers. 
Solved within 2 weeks.
ACCESS TO EDUCATION
British 7-year-old able to access Bulgarian public school free of
charge
A British national migrated with her family to Bulgaria to start a business.
She applied for a place in a publicly funded school for her seven-year-old son
and was told that she had to pay a fee of EUR 800. Bulgarian children do not pay
school fees, and therefore the school’s actions were discriminatory under
EU rules. As a result of SOLVIT’s intervention, the Bulgarian authorities
changed their rules, and now all eligible children of EU nationals have free
access to compulsory education. 
Solved within 13 weeks.
VISAS
Romanian citizen can travel with her Indian husband to France
A Romanian citizen, married to an Indian citizen, both residing in Malta,
applied for a visa for the husband to travel to France, where he was to attend a
university MBA course. The French embassy informed them that the normal Schengen
visa procedure was applicable in this case and that it would take some time. As
the start of the academic year approached, and the need became urgent, they
decided to seek the help of SOLVIT. According to Community law, in such a case
the visa should be issued free of charge and by means of an accelerated
procedure. Following SOLVIT’s intervention, the visa was issued the
following day.
Solved within one week.
NON- DISCRIMINATION[  ][Image]The rights of a Swede in Austria to participate in championship
sportsA Swede living in Austria was prevented from playing his favourite
sport of curling. The Austrian Curling Federation rules stipulated that
non-Austrian players could only participate in the Austrian championships if
they had been living in Austria for the previous 18 months. Moreover, only one
non-Austrian player was allowed in each team. SOLVIT pointed out that these
rules were discriminatory and persuaded the federation to remove the quota for
foreigners from their regulations. Solved within 18
weeks.RESIDENCE RIGHTS
Brazilian spouse of a French citizen receives a residence card in
Ireland
A Brazilian citizen moved to Ireland with his French-Brazilian wife.  He
applied for a residence card as the spouse of an EU citizen. When he had
received no answer after more than six months, he turned to SOLVIT for help. 
SOLVIT quickly cleared up the problem - apparently the favourable decision has
already been issued, but had not reached the applicant. The authority concerned
was given the applicant's new address and sent him the decision again.Solved within 3 weeks.
Dutch citizen's husband obtains residence card in FranceA Dutch
citizen, who lived in France with her non-EU husband and their children, was
experiencing many problems in obtaining a residence card for the husband. The
file was lost several times and the prefecture in their town of residence
refused to apply EU law. SOLVIT contacted the prefecture and clarified the
situation; as a result, the prefecture recognized the complainant's right to
receive a residence card. 
Solved within 2 weeks.
Greek worker receives a residence card in Belgium
A Greek cross-border worker employed in Luxembourg, and living in Belgium,
tried to register in a Belgian municipality to obtain a 5-year residence card.
The Belgian authorities refused his request because he did not have a contract
with an employer based in Belgium. SOLVIT clarified the situation and explained
to the client which procedure he should follow. As a result, the client obtained
his residence card without any further problems. 
Solved within 9 weeks.
Norwegian citizen's husband can work in the United Kingdom
A Norwegian doctor and her American husband settled in the United Kingdom.
The husband, who was also a doctor, experienced delays in obtaining his
residence card in the United Kingdom and was not allowed to start working
without the document. SOLVIT Norway contacted SOLVIT United Kingdom, who managed
to persuade the competent authority to speed up the processing of the case.
After just a few days, the doctor obtained the necessary documents, and was able
to start work at the hospital. 
Solved within one week.
Finnish citizen obtains permanent residence rights in Luxembourg
A Finnish citizen who has legally resided in Luxembourg for more than ten
years encountered problems when he applied for permanent residence, to which he
was entitled under EU law. The Luxembourg authorities still required him to
prove sufficient financial resources by producing a contract of employment.
After SOLVIT's intervention, the competent authority acknowledged the
applicant's right to permanent residence without any further requirements. 
Solved within one week.
CAR REGISTRATION
SOLVIT helps British citizen to register a German car in Portugal
A British citizen with a car licensed under German plates had been waiting to
have her car registered in Portugal for almost a year and a half. This caused
her very serious inconvenience as she lived in a remote area and her car was her
only means of transport. The car was overdue for its yearly inspection and the
applicant was afraid that the situation would cause her even more problems with
the Portuguese authorities. SOLVIT helped her obtain the registration document
quickly. 
Solved within 2 weeks.
Solvit ensures refund of VAT on an imported vehicle 
A citizen moving from France to the Netherlands took his car with him. The
Dutch authorities considered the move of his car as an inter-community purchase,
and therefore required him to pay VAT, even though he had already, correctly,
paid the tax in France. Solvit managed to obtain a refund of the amount of EUR 2
343 of VAT that the applicant had paid in the Netherlands. The tax services had
argued that the car was newly imported to the Netherlands, but in fact it had
been purchased and registered in France when the complainant was still living
there. 
Solved within 10 weeks.
FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES
SOLVIT helps Portuguese company in France
A temporary work agency in Portugal assigned its workers to provide temporary
services in the construction sector in France. One of the workers was an Angolan
citizen, who had been resident in Portugal for 16 years, had a contract with the
Portuguese company and held a Portuguese resident's permit valid for 5 years.
The French labour inspectorate obliged the Angolan national to stop working
because of doubts concerning the Portuguese residence permit. This caused a
serious problem for the company which was losing a large amount of money every
day, because the Angolan employee was prevented from carrying out his duties.
After several clarifications, SOLVIT managed to convince the French authorities
that the Angolan employee of the Portuguese company should be allowed to
continue his temporary work in France. 
Solved within 2 weeks.
MARKET ACCESS FOR PRODUCTS[  ][Image]SOLVIT helps to give Polish houses a coat of Austrian paintAn
Austrian producer of varnish and paints was having difficulties marketing his
products in Poland. The Polish authorities insisted that the name of the Polish
distributor must appear on the label, as well as that of the manufacturer.
SOLVIT pointed out that, under EU rules, only one name was required on the
label: i.e. that of the manufacturer, importer or distributor. The Polish
authorities duly confirmed that the producer was not obliged to indicate the
contact details of the Polish distributor on the package. 
Solved within 17 weeks.SOLVIT clears the way for Czech products on the Slovak market
A Czech company importing goods from other EU Member States onto the Slovak
market was required to obtain additional certificates from Slovak laboratories,
even though the products had certificates from other appropriate EU testing
laboratories. SOLVIT managed to clarify the problem with the competent
authority, which gave an assurance that the current certificates are sufficient.Solved within 4 weeks.
