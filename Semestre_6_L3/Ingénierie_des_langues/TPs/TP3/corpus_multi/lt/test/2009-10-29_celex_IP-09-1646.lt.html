These improvements include the re-establishment of near natural and dynamic river flow systems, as well as associated floodplain structures. A secondary channel will be re-opened to the river Rhine and other habitat works will target restoration of natural river depths, bank structures, currents, sediments and sediment dynamics. Measures will be introduced to mitigate against habitat damage from waves caused by passing ships and efforts will be invested to safeguard appropriate hydrological functions such as groundwater tables, flooding-parameters and currents. Natural features will be extended to improve habitats for breeding or resident waders and other birds including arctic geese, swans and meadow species. Life+ Möhneaue This project aims to restore the indigenous woods of the Möhne valley and its floodplain. This will improve the status of a number of floodplain habitats listed in the Habitats Directive, including the priority habitat (Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior). The works should also aid the conservation status of species such as the brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), bullhead (Cottus gobius), kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) and black stork (Ciconia nigra – a species dependent on structurally diverse floodplains as a feeding habitat). Life Projekt "Lippeaue" The overall project objective is to preserve and enhance the conservation status in four sub-areas of the Lippe floodplain between Hangfort and Hamm (SCI) – areas where, as yet, no ecological modifications have been carried out. The project will aim to improve the connection between the river and its floodplain in order to support the development of typical alluvial and river habitats. Obermain (The Bavarian environment ministry - Staatsministerium für Umwelt, Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz) The project’s overall objective is to ensure that the Upper Main valley remains an important corridor for water and wetland habitats and their characteristic species. Such a goal will contribute to the Natura 2000 network and will be achieved by wetland habitat work that targets 40 breeding and 26 migratory bird species listed in Annex I of the Birds Directive. In addition, the project will also support habitats for species listed in Annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive. Further activities will help protect, improve and integrate water and floodplain habitats listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive. Particular attention will be paid to standing vegetated water bodies, water courses and rivers with vegetation or mud banks; alluvial and riparian forests; lowland hay meadows; and hydrophilous tall herb fringe communities. Outcomes of these conservation actions will lead to improved and enlarged water and wetland habitats. Keiljungfer The main aim of this project is to improve the conservation status of green club-tailed dragonfly populations in Bavaria, via a co-ordinated set of habitat improvements in local watercourses. Kalkmoore Brandenburgs This project aims to stop the rapid loss of “base-rich to alkaline fens” (brown moss fens) in the German federal state of Brandenburg and contribute to the restoration, development and improvement of near-natural lowland-brown moss fens. Alkaline fens appear in all 14 project sites, covering two SPAs and 12 SCIs. Wetterauer Hutungen This project’s core objective focuses on safeguarding the long-term conservation, development and restoration of species-rich heath, grassland and rock habitats in the Wetterauer Trockeninsel area. Project actions will cover six grasslands habitats listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive. All of these habitats depend on extensive land use practices, especially sheep grazing and mowing. LIFE-AMPHIKULT The main aim of the project is to create reproduction pond sites for the amphibians Pelobates fuscus, Bufo calamita, Hyla arborea, Rana arvalis and Rana lessonae on extensively used meadows and pastures. The ponds will also help support other endangered species, including amphibians (Triturus cristatus, Bombina variegata), dragonflies, water beetles and hydrophilic plant species. Habitat management interventions will take place in 15 locations, seven of which are in NATURA 2000 sites. Ems-Dynamik+Habitate The project’s main objectives include: lengthening and widening some 4 km of the river course at Einen; facilitating natural river flow dynamics in general; strengthening existing and developing new flood plain areas; creating uninterrupted passages for fauna; and demonstrating best practice in these types of conservation actions. Soonwald The project aims to carry out rewetting and water management measures to improve the conservation status of the mires and forests within the project area. The main actions will focus on the blocking of ditches (to re-wet the mires), and redirecting surface run-off into neighbouring forest stands. In addition, the removal of spruce from the humid and moist sites should benefit the old growth oaks. Elbauen bei Vockerode The Elbe by Vockerode project will establish a favourable conservation status of the unique riverine landscape and will result in the improvement and long-term safeguarding of this middle Elbe site. The project will connect the natural conservation functions inherent in riparian dynamics and floodplain development with aspects of flood protection. The main objective of the project will be to enable natural succession dynamics of the entire area and to ensure a unique floodplain landscape and a favourable water status. The dyke relocation will result in extra retention areas, and the preventative values of natural ecological flood protection will be enhanced. LIFE+ Information and Communication (two projects - €4.1 million) European Business and Biodiversity Campaign (Global Nature Fund) This project aims to improve awareness and understanding among corporate decision-makers about impacts of business operations and about business opportunities in relation to biodiversity conservation. It will do this by promoting biodiversity partnerships between business, NGOs and other stakeholders and providing information about existing Business and Biodiversity Initiatives such as the EU Business and Biodiversity Initiative/Technical Platform, IUCN Countdown 2010, Germany’s Business and Biodiversity Initiative and other national and regional initiatives. The project will refine the global challenge of loss of biodiversity to the local level, and motivate and support concrete action by SMEs at local and regional level. It will assist business to adapt to key legislation such as the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Natura 2000 network. Netze des Lebens (BUND - Friends of the Earth Germany) The project will raise awareness and increase the acceptance of the necessity of connecting forest ecosystems, thereby creating corridors for migratory species, such as the wild cat.

Options for alternatives to poison in agricultural activities, the creation and training of specialised poison patrols and empowering civil society to fight against poisoning cases in court are also foreseen. CUBOMED The main objective of this project is to gain sufficient understanding about blooms of potentiql invasive species Carybdea marsupialis in order to help develop measures capable of mitigating negative impacts from the jellyfish on Mediterranean marine ecosystems in Europe. This Caribbean jellyfish invasion was detected for the first time in Spanish waters in the summer of 2008. There are concerns that climate change may be affecting spatial dynamics and population behaviour in the Mediterranean. In addition, the project expects to obtain sufficient information to restore 120 ha of a marine coastal habitat that has been invaded by C. marsupialis and remove more than 70% of adult population. ZEPA ESTEPARIAS ANDALUCIA This project aims to improve the conservation status of steppe-land birds in Andalusia. Priority species for the project’s support include: great bustard, little bustard, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, black-bellied sand grouse, collared pratincole, European roller and little kestrel. Actions will be designed to provide food and shelter, reduce mortality risks, increase awareness about conservation considerations, and introduce technology to improve/implement plans for the management of these endangered species. For these purposes, the project aims to introduce farming and agrarian practices that allow the coexistence between the productive activity and the steppe-birds, paying special attention to the diversification of agricultural landscape. Closely involvement of farmers' organisations is foreseen. Riparia-Ter The main focus for this project is the recovery of at least 75ha of riparian habitats in the river Ter area, especially the alluvial forests with alders and willows, and temporary Mediterranean ponds. Works will cover habitat restoration actions supported by complementary measures to manage development pressures affecting the target sites.

The pump exclusively uses the natural resources of oxygen-rich surface water and wave energy to improve the oxygen situation in hypoxic bottom water layers by enhanced ventilation and mixing. ITEST (Municipality of Oskarshamn) The project aims to demonstrate an innovative technical solution to sewage treatment, based on heat exchange. It is hoped this will solve treatment problems incurred by regions with a cold winter climate: cold weather impedes the effective biological conversion of different nitrogen species to elemental nitrogen, thus contributing to nitrogen-based pollution of lakes and seas. LIFE+ Nature &amp; Biodiversity (five projects - €21.9 million) SAMBAH The overall aim of the project is to apply a best practice methodology to provide data for the reliable assessment of the distribution and habitats of the Baltic Sea subpopulation of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). This should enable the designation of sites of Community importance (SCIs) for the endangered species within the Natura 2000 network, and also provide other relevant mitigation measures. Hotad hävdad mark This project aims to preserve valuable grasslands and their associated flora and fauna. The overriding objective is to restore the meadows, pastures and wetland meadows in 62 Natura 2000 sites in Jämtland, Gävleborg, Värmland and Dalarna County. These grasslands all need to be maintained through grazing or cutting, the continuation and intensity of which are crucial for their protection and the good conservation status of the species they harbour. In total, the area of grassland being cleared or restored is almost 630 ha. MOTH The objective of this demonstration project is to develop a cost-effective national monitoring system adapted for northern European conditions that will directly be applicable to use by he European Commission in the implementation of the Habitats Directive. The project will show how auxiliary information can be used in connection with random sampling to improve the accuracy of the habitat assessments for sparse habitats as well. It will also show how the habitat monitoring system can be integrated in the framework of existing landscape level monitoring programmes that exist today in many European countries. Vindel River Life The general objective of the project is to achieve a good water status for the Vindel river with reference to the Water Framework Directive, and a good conservation status for the species in the project area (under the Habitats Directive). This will be achieved by reducing or removing obstructions on 22 tributaries of the Vindel. By the end of the project, 73% of obstructions to the natural river flow will have been removed and the conservation status of the river system should be considerably increased. Certain constructions built for the former timber floating activities will be kept for their heritage value. Life to ad(d)mire This project aims to halt the decrease of bogs and mires habitats and their species at 35 Natura 2000 sites in over 3 852 ha through hydrological restoration and vegetation measures. Without the project measures this decrease would be inevitable in the long term. One positive side-effect is that the current loss of CO2 (caused by drainage of peat) will stop, and, hopefully, most of the hydrologically restored active bogs’ sites will become carbon sinks just as they once were. The project also aims to disseminate information on wetland ecology and the importance of mires to the public and to management staff and landowners.
