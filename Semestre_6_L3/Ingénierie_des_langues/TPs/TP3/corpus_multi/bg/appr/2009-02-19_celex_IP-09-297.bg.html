IP/09/   297   Брюксел, 19 февруари 2009 г.    Годишните доклади за резултатите в областта на вътрешния пазар/SOLVIT и Службата за съвети на гражданите:      държавите-членки поддържат висок процент на въвеждане на правилата в националните законодателства, но се изискват повече действия по практическото им приложение      Според последния доклад на Европейската комисия за напредъка в областта на вътрешния пазар държавите-членки продължават да се справят успешно със своевременното въвеждане на договорените правила относно вътрешния пазар в националните им законодателства.      Средно, едва 1,0 % от директивите в областта на вътрешния пазар с изтекли крайни срокове за транспониране все още не са въведени в националното законодателство.     Това означава, че повечето държави-членки са в съответствие с новата цел от 1,0 %, договорена от държавните ръководители.     Седемнадесет държави-членки са достигнали целта, като Дания и Малта заедно са с най-добрия резултат.     Общо 14 държави-членки са достигнали или запазили най-добрия си досегашен резултат.     Това обаче не е всичко.     Настоящият доклад за напредъка в областта на вътрешния пазар представя степента на постигнатата икономическа интеграция и онагледява значителните възможности за по-нататъшна интеграция, ако и когато се премахнат съществуващите препятствия, и едновременно с това показва доколко добре държавите-членки прилагат на практика правилата на вътрешния пазар.     В това отношение състоянието не е задоволително:     данните сочат, че средният брой на случаите на неправилно приложение е нараснал до 49 на държава-членка и че тяхното разрешаване отнема прекалено дълго време. Според годишните доклади на SOLVIT и Службата за съвети на гражданите, (CSS), за да разрешават проблемите си във вътрешния пазар, гражданите и предприятията все по-често се обръщат към службите на ЕС за разрешаване на проблеми и консултации, вместо да прибягват към формални процедури за подаване на жалби.    Трите доклада – за резултатите в областта на вътрешния пазар, SOLVIT и CSS – сега се издават в пакет, което подчертава тясната връзка между въвеждането на законодателството и разрешаването на проблемите във вътрешния пазар.      Въвеждане на директивите за вътрешния пазар   -        При ниво от 1,0 %, средният дефицит при транспонирането, т.е. процентът на свързаните с вътрешния пазар директиви, които не са въведени навреме  в националните законодателства на 27-те държави-членки, отново e в съответствие с новата цел за дефицита, която следва да се постигне до 2009 г. Това обаче все още означава, че 92 директиви за вътрешния пазар не са транспонирани навреме в националните законодателства. Сроковете за транспонирането на 22 от тези 92 директиви са изтекли преди повече от 2 години.  -        14 държави-членки постигнаха или изравниха най-добрия си досегашен резултат: Дания, Малта, Нидерландия, Румъния, Латвия, Унгария, Финландия, Франция, Австрия, Ирландия, Чешката република, Португалия, Словения и Словакия.  -         Дания и Малта  (0,3 %) споделят първото място, като само 5 директиви ги делят от нулевия дефицит.  -        Най-впечатляващ прогрес е постигнала Чешката република, която е намалила дефицита си с 1,1 %, свеждайки го до 1,4 %.  -        От друга страна Кипър, Гърция, Люксембург, Португалия и Полша не са успели да постигнат целта от 1,5 %.  -         Дефицитът на Люксембург и Полша при транспонирането е около два пъти по-голям от средния за Европейския съюз.   Нарушения   -        Най-много случай на открити нарушения имат Италия и Испания.  Независимо от това Италия е успяла да постигне най-голямо намаление на откритите процедури при нарушения (15), следвана от Франция (9), Испания и Малта (5).  От друга страна броят на случаите в Белгия и Словакия е нараснал съответно с 14 и 11 открити нови процедури.  -        Броят на процедурите при нарушения е нараснал и в 3 ( Гърция, Португалия и Полша) от петте държави-членки с най-лоши резултати при навременното транспониране (Кипър, Гърция, Люксембург, Португалия и Полша).  Новата глава относно състоянието на икономическата интеграция в доклада за напредъка в областта на вътрешния пазар показва, че разширяването може да се разглежда като основен двигател на по-нататъшната интеграция в рамките на вътрешния пазар, като повечето то държавите-членки от EС-10 са в голяма степен отворени по отношение на вноса и преките инвестиции от други държави-членки.  Във всички държави-членки вътреобщностната стокова търговия е много по-силно развита (и представлява 16,9 % от БВП през 2007 г.) отколкото вътреобщностната търговия с услуги (5 % от БВП), което показва значителния потенциал за по-нататъшна интеграция.  SOLVIT и Службата за съвети на гражданите продължават да помагат на хиляди европейци    През 2008 г. потокът от случаи, отправени към SOLVIT нарасна с още 22 % до 1 000 случая, а процентът на разрешените случаи остана висок и възлиза на 83 %.      Разрешаването на казусите обикновен отнема два месеца.      Спестените разходи в резултат на разрешаването на проблемите на гражданите и предприятията чрез SOLVIT се оценяват на 32,6 млн. EUR през 2008 г. (приложими по отношение на 25 % от всички разрешени случаи и основаващи се на разходите при неразрешаване на проблема).        Службата за съвети на гражданите (CSS), която предоставя на гражданите безплатни персонализирани правни консултации и информационни центрове за допълнителни консултации е отговорила през 2008 г. на около 11 000 запитвания, а в над 90 % от случаите отговорите са получени в рамките на три работни дни.     Анализът на запитванията, отправени към CSS, и на случаите, разгледани от SOLVIT, предоставя пряка връзка със затрудненията на гражданите и предприятията и помага за установяването на въпросите, които все още трябва да бъдат разрешени, за да се подобри работата на вътрешния пазар.     През 2008 г. и двете служби получиха голям брой заявки в областта на социалната сигурност, професионалните квалификации и свободното движение на хора.  Заслужава да се отбележи и че късното транспониране или неефективното прилагане на някои правила на вътрешния пазар обикновено води до увеличаване на броя на случаите, насочени към тези служби, например в областта на правото на престой и професионалните квалификации.

Reply: He is informed of the relevant EU legislation, namely of Council Directive 93/13 on unfair terms in contracts and his rights under this legislation, and advised to consult the local European Consumer Centre and other private consumer organisations in case the telecom operator does not consider his complaint.  The citizen later wrote to express his satisfaction with the answer provided by CSS: “Through your help we have been able to recover 429€ from our telecom operator”.  Travel rights for non-EU spouses  Question: A British citizen wants to travel to another EU country, where she has a family house, with her non-EU husband but is encountering difficulties in obtaining a visa for him. The authorities of the host country charge an administration fee and insist that the husband provides proof of his employment together with an invitation from both the citizen and her mother (who is co-owner of the family house) to stay there. They are requested to fill in forms even though it is clearly stated that particular questions need not be answered by the spouses of EU citizens. The British citizen seeks for advice.  Reply: She is informed that her husband should be granted a visa free of charge and without undue formality by the national authorities. It should not be necessary for him to provide proof of employment or an invitation, nor should he have to pay an administration fee. The requirements of the national authorities seem to go beyond the requirements of EU law. The citizen is advised to contact the relevant authorities.  The citizen wrote back to thank CSS for its advice, which allowed the spouse of the British citizen to travel without undue formalities.  Social security  Question: A Polish citizen working in Austria for 12 years asks if he can get Austrian family benefits even if his wife and four children live in Poland, where she is registered with the unemployment office.  Reply: He is informed that the European rules provide that, as a resident in the territory of another Member State, he is subject to the same obligations and enjoys the same benefits under the legislation of that State as its nationals, and that he could claim the right to certain social security benefits granted by Austrian social security scheme, even if his family members lived in another Member State.  The citizen wrote back saying that the CSS advice eventually enabled him to get family benefits in Austria.

However, the German authorities were reluctant to issue a work permit that would be valid for more than one year. SOLVIT pointed out that, under the Accession Treaty, the person was entitled to a permanent work permit and convinced the authorities to issue the document.  Solved within 2 weeks.   SOCIAL SECURITY           Figures and graphics available in PDF and WORD PROCESSED              Italian citizen gets unjustified fee cancelled in France   An Italian citizen worked for two months in France in Euro Disney. She needed urgent medical assistance and was operated on in a public hospital. Afterwards she was asked to pay EUR 12 494.46 for the assistance received, despite the fact that this cost should have been covered by the insurance. Thanks to SOLVIT's intervention, the error was corrected and the invoice was sent to the insurance company. Solved within 5 weeks.      British citizen receives his pension from Portugal A British citizen worked in Portugal as a teacher for a couple of years and each month contributed about 10% of his salary to the Portuguese Pension Scheme. When he retired, he returned to the United Kingdom and applied for payment of his pension. Having tried unsuccessfully for over four years to receive his pension, he turned to a Member of the European Parliament for assistance. The MEP contacted SOLVIT and, very quickly, the applicant not only received his backdated pension but was also assured that his monthly pension would be paid on a regular basis.  Solved within 14 weeks.   Problems with birth allowance clarified in Belgium  A Belgian citizen living in Belgium had a husband who was living in Luxembourg. Their child was born in Belgium and she received a birth allowance from the Belgian authorities. After the birth, she went to live with her husband in Luxembourg. As a result, the Belgian authorities claimed repayment of the birth allowance, arguing that family benefits should be paid by Luxembourg. However, Luxembourg did not want to pay either. SOLVIT made it clear that it was up to the Belgian authorities to pay this birth allowance, since the baby had been born in Belgium, and it convinced the Belgian authorities that they were not entitled to claim the money back.  Solved within 6 weeks.      Ensures unemployment benefits for Czech citizen returning from Ireland  A Czech citizen, who worked in Ireland for more than one year, decided to return to the Czech Republic. Before she left Ireland, she applied there for a document setting out her entitlements to unemployment benefit. Five months after her application, she turned to SOLVIT for help. The form was issued immediately after SOLVIT's intervention.   Solved within one week.   SOLVIT solves cross-border pension problem  A Hungarian citizen applied for a widow's pension from the German authorities since her late husband had worked in Germany for most of his working life. However, seven months after her application, she had still heard nothing from the German authorities. SOLVIT discovered that the delay was due to the provisions of an old German law that recognised pension rights to foreigners only if they were living in Germany. SOLVIT intervened to point out that this practice was not in line with EU law and with the principle of free movement of workers. Following this intervention, the German competent authority recognised the widow's pension rights.  Solved within one week.   Greek citizen does not have to pay double social security contributions  A Greek engineer, working as a self-employed person in Greece, expanded his activities into Belgium. Since in Belgium he was also working as a self-employed person, he presented the appropriate E101 forms to the Belgian authorities, explaining that he was covered by the Greek social security scheme. However, as he had registered himself and his family in a Belgian commune and had a Belgian VAT number, the Belgian authorities considered him to be permanently resident in Belgium and asked him to pay social security contributions for his past 4 years of activity in Belgium, which amounted to EUR 22.000. Following the intervention of SOLVIT Belgium, the Belgian authorities agreed to reconsider the case and recognised Greece as the client's main place of residence.  Solved within 13 weeks.   Swedish student registered with an Italian municipality  A Swedish citizen, currently studying in Italy, experienced some difficulties in trying to register with the Italian municipality where she resided because it did not accept her European Health Insurance Card as proof of her health insurance cover in Sweden. The student was informed that she might be prevented from completing her studies unless she obtained an Italian insurance. SOLVIT contacted the municipality and cleared up the misunderstanding. The student had been registered and did not have to take out complementary insurance as initially demanded by the Italian authorities.  Solved within 9 weeks.   SOLVIT helps Czech citizen obtain an E 104 form from Denmark  A Czech citizen worked in Denmark for six months. When he returned to the Czech Republic, the Health Insurance Company informed him that he had to pay health insurance contributions for the period of six months during which he had been abroad, unless he could produce an E 104 form completed by the Danish Authority. Although the Danish Authority provided the client with a document showing the detailed tax records, this was not acceptable to the Czech Health Insurance Company, which insisted on receiving the E 104 form. Thanks to SOLVIT DK, the E 104 form was issued within a few days.  Solved within 3 weeks.      SOLVIT helps an Estonian bus driver to get a good night’s sleep  An Estonian bus driver, who had worked and lived in Finland for 5 years, needed medical help for sleeping disorders related to his occupation. However, although he was covered by Finnish health insurance, he was refused treatment in the Finnish hospital on the argument that he was no longer under the Finnish social security system. With the help of the Finnish SOLVIT centre, the problem was cleared up and the client was able to receive the treatment to which he was entitled.  Solved within 11 weeks.   SOLVIT arranges payment of medical invoices sent to holidaymakers  In two separate instances, an Italian and an Austrian citizen were on holiday in the Netherlands when they had to have urgent medical treatment. They showed their European Health Insurance Cards and were treated. After returning home, they received invoices from the Netherlands, and were expected to pay for the medical service. Solvit contacted the hospitals and the invoices were redirected to the national contact points, which ensured that payment was duly processed.  Solved within 5 weeks.   REGULATED PROFESSIONS               Figures and graphics available in PDF and WORD PROCESSED              Hungarian diploma recognised in France   A French citizen with a Hungarian nursing diploma applied for recognition of her professional qualifications in France so that she could take up employment. However, the competent authority did not react within the six-month deadline laid down by EU law. This delay was jeopardising her chances of accepting the job she had been offered. Thanks to SOLVIT's intervention, the committee responsible for the decision assessed her file and proceeded swiftly to fully recognise her qualifications.    Solved within 9 weeks.        Qualifications of the Belgian teacher recognized in Portugal  A Belgian teacher with a diploma in Physical Education, Sports and Leisure Activities, residing in Portugal, wanted the Portuguese authorities to recognize his professional diploma. He had been trying to get an answer to his application since 2001, but it was not until recently (7 years after his initial request!) that the competent authority informed him that his application had been rejected. SOLVIT Portugal persuaded the Portuguese competent authority to reconsider his file and grant the professional recognition of his Belgian diploma in accordance with EU law.   Solved within 7 weeks.      SOLVIT helps Polish doctor in Spain  A Polish citizen applied for recognition of her medical qualifications in Spain. Even though according to EU law the procedure for examining an application must be completed as quickly as possible, and in any event within 3 months of the submission of a complete file, the citizen had been waiting over four months for the recognition. Thanks to the intervention of SOLVIT, the Spanish authorities eventually assessed the applicant's qualifications.  Solved within 9 weeks.   British nurse obtains recognition of her qualifications in France  A fully qualified British nurse moved to France but was unable to obtain recognition of her professional qualifications because her documentation referred to a recently adopted EU law, which had not yet been implemented in France. She was thus unable to support herself or to begin her new life in France. Following SOLVIT's intervention, the French regional authority acknowledged its obligation to accept applications under the new EU legislation and the nurse's application was accepted immediately.  Solved within 4 weeks.               Figures and graphics available in PDF and WORD PROCESSED              SOLVIT makes sure Romanian physiotherapists can sit exam in Italy    Five Romanian citizens wanted to have their physiotherapist qualifications recognised in Italy. The Italian competent authority assessed their files and asked them to choose a compensation measure, i.e. either a training period or an exam. Although the citizens informed the authority of their choice, the Ministry failed to organise the exam, thereby obliging the citizens to wait. Thanks to SOLVIT's intervention, the Ministry agreed to organise the exam. All five physiotherapists passed and had their qualifications recognised.    Solved within 4 weeks.           SOLVIT helps Portuguese entrepreneurs to start a business in Luxembourg  Three Portuguese citizens working in Luxembourg as employees of a company dealing with construction and public works wanted to establish their own company in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg authorities required them to present an official document certifying their professional experience. After several unsuccessful attempts to obtain the requisite document from the Portuguese authorities, they decided to contact SOLVIT Portugal, who persuaded the relevant authority to provide the papers.  Solved within 2 weeks.     ACCESS TO EDUCATION   British 7-year-old able to access Bulgarian public school free of charge  A British national migrated with her family to Bulgaria to start a business. She applied for a place in a publicly funded school for her seven-year-old son and was told that she had to pay a fee of EUR 800. Bulgarian children do not pay school fees, and therefore the school’s actions were discriminatory under EU rules. As a result of SOLVIT’s intervention, the Bulgarian authorities changed their rules, and now all eligible children of EU nationals have free access to compulsory education.  Solved within 13 weeks.   VISAS   Romanian citizen can travel with her Indian husband to France  A Romanian citizen, married to an Indian citizen, both residing in Malta, applied for a visa for the husband to travel to France, where he was to attend a university MBA course. The French embassy informed them that the normal Schengen visa procedure was applicable in this case and that it would take some time. As the start of the academic year approached, and the need became urgent, they decided to seek the help of SOLVIT. According to Community law, in such a case the visa should be issued free of charge and by means of an accelerated procedure. Following SOLVIT’s intervention, the visa was issued the following day.  Solved within one week.   NON- DISCRIMINATION                   Figures and graphics available in PDF and WORD PROCESSED              The rights of a Swede in Austria to participate in championship sports   A Swede living in Austria was prevented from playing his favourite sport of curling. The Austrian Curling Federation rules stipulated that non-Austrian players could only participate in the Austrian championships if they had been living in Austria for the previous 18 months. Moreover, only one non-Austrian player was allowed in each team. SOLVIT pointed out that these rules were discriminatory and persuaded the federation to remove the quota for foreigners from their regulations.     Solved within 18 weeks.             RESIDENCE RIGHTS   Brazilian spouse of a French citizen receives a residence card in Ireland  A Brazilian citizen moved to Ireland with his French-Brazilian wife.  He applied for a residence card as the spouse of an EU citizen. When he had received no answer after more than six months, he turned to SOLVIT for help.  SOLVIT quickly cleared up the problem - apparently the favourable decision has already been issued, but had not reached the applicant. The authority concerned was given the applicant's new address and sent him the decision again.   Solved within 3 weeks.   Dutch citizen's husband obtains residence card in France   A Dutch citizen, who lived in France with her non-EU husband and their children, was experiencing many problems in obtaining a residence card for the husband. The file was lost several times and the prefecture in their town of residence refused to apply EU law. SOLVIT contacted the prefecture and clarified the situation; as a result, the prefecture recognized the complainant's right to receive a residence card.   Solved within 2 weeks.   Greek worker receives a residence card in Belgium  A Greek cross-border worker employed in Luxembourg, and living in Belgium, tried to register in a Belgian municipality to obtain a 5-year residence card. The Belgian authorities refused his request because he did not have a contract with an employer based in Belgium. SOLVIT clarified the situation and explained to the client which procedure he should follow. As a result, the client obtained his residence card without any further problems.   Solved within 9 weeks.   Norwegian citizen's husband can work in the United Kingdom  A Norwegian doctor and her American husband settled in the United Kingdom. The husband, who was also a doctor, experienced delays in obtaining his residence card in the United Kingdom and was not allowed to start working without the document. SOLVIT Norway contacted SOLVIT United Kingdom, who managed to persuade the competent authority to speed up the processing of the case. After just a few days, the doctor obtained the necessary documents, and was able to start work at the hospital.  Solved within one week.   Finnish citizen obtains permanent residence rights in Luxembourg  A Finnish citizen who has legally resided in Luxembourg for more than ten years encountered problems when he applied for permanent residence, to which he was entitled under EU law. The Luxembourg authorities still required him to prove sufficient financial resources by producing a contract of employment. After SOLVIT's intervention, the competent authority acknowledged the applicant's right to permanent residence without any further requirements.  Solved within one week.     CAR REGISTRATION   SOLVIT helps British citizen to register a German car in Portugal  A British citizen with a car licensed under German plates had been waiting to have her car registered in Portugal for almost a year and a half. This caused her very serious inconvenience as she lived in a remote area and her car was her only means of transport. The car was overdue for its yearly inspection and the applicant was afraid that the situation would cause her even more problems with the Portuguese authorities. SOLVIT helped her obtain the registration document quickly.  Solved within 2 weeks.   Solvit ensures refund of VAT on an imported vehicle  A citizen moving from France to the Netherlands took his car with him. The Dutch authorities considered the move of his car as an inter-community purchase, and therefore required him to pay VAT, even though he had already, correctly, paid the tax in France. Solvit managed to obtain a refund of the amount of EUR 2 343 of VAT that the applicant had paid in the Netherlands. The tax services had argued that the car was newly imported to the Netherlands, but in fact it had been purchased and registered in France when the complainant was still living there.  Solved within 10 weeks.   FREEDOM TO PROVIDE SERVICES   SOLVIT helps Portuguese company in France  A temporary work agency in Portugal assigned its workers to provide temporary services in the construction sector in France. One of the workers was an Angolan citizen, who had been resident in Portugal for 16 years, had a contract with the Portuguese company and held a Portuguese resident's permit valid for 5 years. The French labour inspectorate obliged the Angolan national to stop working because of doubts concerning the Portuguese residence permit. This caused a serious problem for the company which was losing a large amount of money every day, because the Angolan employee was prevented from carrying out his duties. After several clarifications, SOLVIT managed to convince the French authorities that the Angolan employee of the Portuguese company should be allowed to continue his temporary work in France.  Solved within 2 weeks.     MARKET ACCESS FOR PRODUCTS                     Figures and graphics available in PDF and WORD PROCESSED              SOLVIT helps to give Polish houses a coat of Austrian paint  An Austrian producer of varnish and paints was having difficulties marketing his products in Poland. The Polish authorities insisted that the name of the Polish distributor must appear on the label, as well as that of the manufacturer. SOLVIT pointed out that, under EU rules, only one name was required on the label: i.e. that of the manufacturer, importer or distributor. The Polish authorities duly confirmed that the producer was not obliged to indicate the contact details of the Polish distributor on the package.   Solved within 17 weeks.                SOLVIT clears the way for Czech products on the Slovak market  A Czech company importing goods from other EU Member States onto the Slovak market was required to obtain additional certificates from Slovak laboratories, even though the products had certificates from other appropriate EU testing laboratories. SOLVIT managed to clarify the problem with the competent authority, which gave an assurance that the current certificates are sufficient.  Solved within 4 weeks.
