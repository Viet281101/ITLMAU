IP/09/1516 Brussels, 14 October 2009 Kosovo* - Fulfilling its European Perspective Today the European Commission proposes to mark a new stage in the EU's relations with Kosovo. In its communication 'Kosovo - Fulfilling its European Perspective', the Commission proposes to start a process that should lead to visa-free travel for Kosovo citizens and to begin preparations for a comprehensive trade agreement once Kosovo meets the requirements. EU Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn said : 'Today's decision marks a new stage. We propose a series of practical measures to help improve the lives of all Kosovo citizens. These measures will show Kosovo that EU approximation is not something abstract, but that it is about real, tangible benefits for all. We now call on EU Member States to agree to our proposals and to ensure Kosovo keeps pace with developments in the rest of the Western Balkans.' This initiative is part of the Commission's 2009 Enlargement Strategy, which also includes the 2009 Progress Report for Kosovo. In November last year, the EU Member States welcomed the Commission's proposal to reflect on ways the EU could help Kosovo's political and socio-economic progress within the overall context of Kosovo's EU perspective. Today, the Commission highlights the key policy areas for Kosovo to address over the next few years, and identifies ways in which the EU can help. It concludes with a list of policy recommendations. The Commission proposes to start work towards visa liberalisation for Kosovo citizens. It also proposes to prepare trade relations with Kosovo. It wants to explore ways for Kosovo to participate in some EC programmes and for Kosovo to be involved in initiatives in areas such as employment, enterprise and education. The Commission also proposes the EU upgrade its political dialogue with Kosovo and widen the scope of EC financial assistance to Kosovo to include cross-border cooperation. EU measures will be implemented progressively, and will depend on progress made by Kosovo. The Commission's proposals do not prejudge EU Member States' position on Kosovo's status. * Under UNSCR 1244/99
