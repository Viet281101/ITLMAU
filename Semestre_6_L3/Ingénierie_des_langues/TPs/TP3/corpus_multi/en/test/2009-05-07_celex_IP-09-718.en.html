Brussels, 7 May 2009EU Employment Summit agrees on ways to
tackle rising unemploymentThe EU today held a special summit in Prague
dedicated to tackling the impact of the economic crisis on jobs in Europe. The
Troika Presidencies (the Czech, Swedish and Spanish governments) joined the
European Commission, employers and trade unions to pool their best ideas on how
to keep people in work and help them back into new jobs. The summit identified
ten actions to fight unemployment and create new jobs. The Commission will build
on the summit's discussions when formulating its input to the European Council
of 18-19 June.
President Barroso said: "Today's EU employment summit is a significant step
towards more and better coordinated action on employment. We cannot prevent this
crisis from causing unemployment. But acting now can reduce job losses, and help
millions of people to find new and better jobs. Acting now also means paving the
way for sustainable recovery. EU action on employment neither starts nor stops
with today's summit. But with today's summit we are telling our citizens that we
want their employment to be Europe's objective number one. I call on all Member
States to commit to work together to swiftly step up action on employment."
"Our first priority in this crisis is people – keeping them in jobs and
getting them back into jobs as quickly as possible. We must use all the tools at
our disposal to limit the impact of the crisis on the real economy, and on
people and their livelihoods in particular" said Vladimír Špidla, EU
Commissioner for Employment. 
"This summit has been an important step in determining how best to tackle
unemployment and create new jobs. Our strategy must be based on strong social
dialogue, acting together and creating a synergy between social and economic
policies. There is no trade-off between core social values and a
competitive internal market."
The summit showed a wide consensus among participants on the way ahead. The 
main messages agreed emphasise that future action on employment should be guided
by a number of principles and aim at maintaining employment and create jobs;
increase access to employment particularly to the young and upgrade skills,
match labour market needs and promote mobility. Ten concrete actions, addressing
both short-term and long-term challenges, are suggested that should be
implemented at national and European levels together with the social partners:1. Maintain as many people as possible in jobs, with temporary adjustment of
working hours combined with retraining and supported by public funding
(including from the European Social Fund).
2. Encourage entrepreneurship and job creation, e.g. by lowering non-wage
labour costs and flexicurity;
3. Improve the efficiency of national employment services by providing
intensive counselling, training and job search in the first weeks of
unemployment, especially for the young unemployed.
4. Increase significantly the number of high quality apprenticeships and
traineeships by the end of 2009.
5. Promote more inclusive labour markets by ensuring work incentives,
effective active labour market policies and modernisation of social protection
systems that also lead to a better integration of disadvantaged groups including
the disabled, the low-skilled and migrants.
6. Upgrade skills at all levels with lifelong learning, in particular giving
all school leavers the necessary skills to find a job.  
7. Use labour mobility to match supply and demand of labour to best
effect.
8. Identify job opportunities and skills requirements, and improve skills
forecasting to get the training offer right.
9. Assist the unemployed and young people in starting their own business,
e.g. by providing business support training and starting capital, or by lowering
or eliminating taxation on start-ups.
10. Anticipate and manage restructuring through mutual learning and exchange
of good practice.The summit also discussed how national and
European-level action could work together to best effect, and how to make the
best use of EU tools and resources such as the European Social Fund and the
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Both funds have recently been revised to
maximise their effectiveness in times of crisis.
To prepare the summit, the European Commission organised a series of
workshops with the current and future EU Presidencies (held in Madrid on 15
April, in Stockholm on 20 April and in Prague on 27 April). In addition, a
special debate was held at the European Parliament in Brussels on 5 May. This
consultation process brought in views from the broadest possible range of
stakeholders including social partners at all levels, representatives from
various EU institutions, Member States, public employment services, academics,
and civil society.
