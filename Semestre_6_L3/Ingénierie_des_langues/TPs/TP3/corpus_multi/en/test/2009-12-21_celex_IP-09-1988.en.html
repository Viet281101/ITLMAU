Launched by Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel on 28 September (see  IP/09/1366 ), under the slogan "Eat it, Drink it, Move it", the website presents a bunch of tasty and sporty fruit, vegetables and dairy characters telling their food-stories to schoolchildren. The Treasure Hunt consists of 8 rounds of 2 questions with the Tasty Bunch helping to find the answers on the website. Kids under 16 may participate and can win nice presents for an energetic start to the year 2010, such as a mountain bike, yoghurt or juice making machines or a full table tennis set. Background The Healthy Eating Campaign runs alongside the EU’s School Fruit Scheme and School Milk Scheme – important initiatives to encourage a more balanced diet and healthier eating habits amongst children. The Healthy Eating Campaign brings the message: Eat it, Drink it, Move it right into schools. Over 17.000 children and their teachers took part in the Tasty Bunch's roadshow games throughout Belgium, France, the UK, Ireland, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland. Feed-back has been very positive with schools calling the event interesting, instructive and interactive. And the show should definitely go on as a large number of requests are calling for a second wave of visits to even more schools all over the EU. The attractive video testimonial featuring Belgian tennis champion Justine Henin and the 8 year old Guinness record holder Rosolino Cannio encouraging children’s eating habits for the better. Parents can also find a range of useful tips and advice on how to get their kids to eat a balanced breakfast or choose a healthier snack between meals. The Teachers' corner offers access to Best initiatives, Facts and figures and Pedagogical tools in all EU languages to support the teachers in their work at school. A recent Eurobarometer survey showed three quarters of respondents “totally agreeing” that “there seems to be more overweight children these days than five years ago". Indeed, around 22 million kids are overweight in the EU, of which 5 million are obese.
