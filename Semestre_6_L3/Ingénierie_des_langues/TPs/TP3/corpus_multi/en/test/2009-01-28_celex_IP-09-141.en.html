Brussels, 28 January 2009Climate change: Commission sets out
proposals for global pact on climate change at CopenhagenThe European Commission today set out its proposals
for a comprehensive and ambitious new global agreement to tackle climate change
and how it could be financed. The new pact is due to be concluded at the
Copenhagen UN climate conference in December. In order to keep temperature
increase below 2°C, developing countries will require substantially higher
funding from the developed world and multilateral institutions to help them
shoulder their contribution to addressing climate change. The Commission’s
proposals include the creation of an OECD-wide carbon market by 2015 and of
innovative international funding sources based on countries' emissions and
ability to pay. 
Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: “Tackling the causes and
impacts of climate change will require significant private and public investment
over coming decades, though these investments will cost far less than letting
climate change continue its destructive course. The European Economic Recovery
Plan and similar measures being taken around the world to address the economic
crisis are a chance to advance the low-carbon investment needed and stimulate
growth, innovation and job creation at the same time. However, further financing
solutions will be vital for getting agreement in Copenhagen. Today’s
Communication makes a key contribution by putting forward a comprehensive set of
proposals for scaling up finance and investment.” 
Copenhagen goal  
The EU’s goal is to limit global warming to less than 2°C above
the pre-industrial temperature as there is strong scientific evidence that
climate change will become dangerous beyond this point. 
The Copenhagen deal should both set global goals to reduce emissions and
provide the basis for strengthening countries’ ability to adapt to climate
change. The Communication[1]
offers concrete proposals to reach these goals. 
Targets and actions  
To stay below 2°C, global emissions need to peak before 2020 and then be
cut to less than 50% of 1990 levels by 2050. This will require action by both
developed and developing countries. 
Developed countries must take the lead and cut their collective
emissions by 30% of 1990 levels by 2020. The EU has set an example by committing
to reduce emissions by 30% if other developed countries commit to comparable
cuts and has already put in place the measures to cut its own emissions by 20%
(IP/08/1998).
The Communication proposes specific parameters to ensure national targets entail
a comparable level of effort. All OECD countries and EU Member States, EU
candidate countries and potential candidates should take on emission targets.Developing countries, except the poorest ones, should limit growth in
their collective emissions to 15-30% below business as usual levels by 2020.
This should include a rapid decrease in emissions from tropical deforestation
(IP/08/1543).
These countries should commit to adopting low-carbon development strategies
covering all key emitting sectors by 2011. A new international mechanism will
assess these strategies and match proposed actions with appropriate external
support. 
Financing low-carbon development 
To reduce emissions, global net additional investment may need to rise
to around €175 billion per year in 2020 according to independent
estimates. More than half of this will be needed in developing countries. Up to
2020 the bulk of actions in these countries will have low costs - or even
benefits - and should be financed domestically. International financial support
for actions exceeding a country’s domestic capabilities should come from
sources including public funds and international carbon crediting mechanisms.The Copenhagen agreement should also provide a framework to help countries
adapt to inevitable climate change. All developed and developing
countries should be required to elaborate national adaptation strategies.
Support for adaptation should be provided to the most vulnerable Least Developed
Countries and small island developing states. 
The EU should explore potential innovative sources of international
funding based on the polluter pays principle and the ability to pay. EU
Member States could also use part of their future revenues from auctioning
allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System to support developing
countries. 
Global carbon market
The EU should seek to build, by 2015, an OECD-wide carbon market by
linking the EU ETS with other comparable cap-and-trade systems in order to
mitigate and to raise funds to fight climate change. The market should be
expanded to include major emerging economies by 2020 with a view to building a
global carbon market.
The Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism should be reformed.
For advanced developing countries and highly competitive economic sectors, the
CDM should be gradually replaced by a sectoral crediting mechanism and
cap-and-trade systems. 
Next steps
The Communication is addressed to the Council, Parliament and EU consultative
bodies. The European Council is expected to give its response in March.
