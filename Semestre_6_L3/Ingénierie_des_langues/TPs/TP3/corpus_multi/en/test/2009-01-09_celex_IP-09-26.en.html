Brussels, 9 January 2009Cinema: EU film support goes
globalToday, the European Commission adopted a new MEDIA
MUNDUS programme, a broad international cooperation programme for the
audiovisual industry to strengthen cultural and commercial relations between
Europe's film industry and film-makers of third countries. The EU will provide
€15 million of funding from 2011-2013 for projects submitted by
audiovisual professionals from the EU and third countries. Cooperation with the
European film industry is in strong demand around the globe as shown by the
initial success of the MEDIA International Preparatory Action under which the EU
provided € 2 million of funding for 18 projects involving international
partners (IP/08/1273).
The new MEDIA MUNDUS programme will run from 2011-2013 and will capitalise on
this growing interest and the opportunities offered by global cooperation of the
audiovisual industry. It will increase consumer choice by bringing more
culturally diverse products to European and international markets and will
create new business opportunities for audiovisual professionals from Europe and
around the globe.
"The international audiovisual landscape has changed significantly over
the last two decades, notably through the impact of technological developments
like video on demand, internet TV or multi-channel digital television This has
created growing demand for more audiovisual content, and we need to 'fill' all
these new technologies with new and exciting content," said Viviane Reding,
EU Media Commissioner. "I think MEDIA MUNDUS is the right cultural
answer to this global technological challenge. The successes of the
current MEDIA programme and MEDIA International have shown the need for a
sequel: It's time to go global. I expect EU citizens to see the results of our
new efforts very quickly in a cinema nearby!" 
The proposed new MEDIA MUNDUS programme will:boost the exchange of information between professionals, particularly
through training activities and scholarships that make networking between
European and third country audiovisual professionals easier. This will improve
access to foreign markets and build trust and long-term commercial
relationships.
improve the competitiveness and transnational
distribution of audiovisual works worldwide by making international
co-productions easier. 
improve circulation and exposure of audiovisual works worldwide and increase
public demand, especially among young audiences, for culturally diverse
audiovisual content. The new MEDIA MUNDUS programme will run from
2011-2013.
