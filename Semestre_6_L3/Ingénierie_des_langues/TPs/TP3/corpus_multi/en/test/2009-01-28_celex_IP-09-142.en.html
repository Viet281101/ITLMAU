Brussels, 28 January 2009The Commission proposes € 5 billion
new investment in energy and Internet broadband infrastructure in 2009-2010, in
support of the EU recovery planAs part of the ongoing implementation of the EU
recovery plan endorsed by the European Council in December 2008, the European
Commission has today presented proposals to invest in key energy and Internet
broadband infrastructure projects. These will deliver a much needed stimulus to
the EU economy in the short term, while at the same time targeting strategic
goals such as energy security. All Member States will benefit from the package
of measures. 
Commission President José Manuel Barroso said: "The EU's Recovery Plan
is all about 'smart investment' – a short-term stimulus targeted on
long-term goals.  That is exactly what the Commission has adopted today: a list
of specific projects to direct € 5 billion of unspent money from the EU
budget to build a stronger Europe for the long term. We need to learn the
lessons of the recent gas crisis and invest heavily in energy. We also need to
stimulate the European economy by providing information highways in rural
communities. The Commission is committed to working together with Member States,
all of whom will benefit from our proposed measures, in revitalising the EU
economy through investment in these key areas."
The package presented today contains:a short Communication outlining the background to and the objectives
of the initiative;
for energy projects: a proposal for a Regulation to grant Community
support to strategic energy projects. A total of € 3.5 billion is proposed
for investment in carbon capture and storage (financial envelope: €1,250
million), offshore wind projects (€500 million), and gas and electricity
interconnection projects (€1,750 million).
for broadband:, the Commission proposes to target € 1 bn to
extend and upgrade high-speed internet in rural communities. This money will be
targeted via the existing EU's Rural Development Fund to cover the "white
spots" on Europe's broadband map (30% of the population in rural areas who do
not have broadband access).
and tackling new challenges identified in the "health check" of the
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): using the existing rural
development mechanisms, this would direct € 0.5 billion to launch the work
of tackling the "new challenges" agreed in the health check. These new
challenges are: climate change, renewable energy, water management, biodiversity
and dairy restructuring. Energy and broadband networks are both
crucial to the future of the EU economy.  
The challenge of energy security was highlighted in Commission's second
strategic energy review of November 2008. Its significance was underlined still
further by the recent gas crisis.  In the current economic and financial
climate, projects are finding it particularly difficult to access investment.
The EU support will put these projects back on track: they will help to plug the
gaps in EU energy interconnections, and keep up the momentum to use the EU's
domestic energy sources to best effect. The projects focus on cross-border needs
and on the development of new technologies essential for Europe's future energy
needs.
The extension and upgrading of high-speed internet infrastructure is an
economic and social imperative. The European Economic Recovery Plan set out a
goal of developing broadband networks to achieve a full 100% high-speed internet
coverage by 2010. However, rural areas will always face additional difficulties
in linking up to broadband. As investment slows to a trickle, this risk is
redoubled. This has direct social and economic consequences.  That is why it is
right to concentrate this action on rural areas – and using the rural
development instruments will allow for action on the ground to start
quickly.
A full list of the projects put forward by the Commission for energy
infrastructures can be found in annex.
Background
In November 2008, as part of its European economic recovery plan, the
Commission suggested the mobilisation in 2009 and 2010 of an additional €
5 billion of unspent money from the EU budget for investment in energy and
broadband projects. The idea was to speed up necessary investment, cushion the
blow of the economic downturn on the construction sector and enhance the EU's
longer term sustainable growth potential through a targeted stimulus into the EU
economy. This is an important contribution to the agreed figure of an economic
stimulus to the tune of 1.5% of GDP, which was made up of both national and EU
action.
The proposal has been presented today by President Barroso in agreement with
Commissioners Piebalgs, Fischer-Boel and Reding. With these proposals, the
Commission is implementing the mandate given to it by the European Council in
December 2008 to come forward speedily with a list of specific projects, taking
into account a suitable geographical balance. In order to maximise the effects
on the general economy quickly, particular emphasis has been given to the need
to start the spending in 2009 and 2010. 
In order to ensure that the proposals can have an impact as quickly as
possible, the Commission hopes that the Council and the European Parliament can
make swift progress on the discussion and adoption of the legislative measures.
The Commission therefore hopes that normal procedures in the other institutions
can be accelerated in order to deliver the package.

on the proposed energy projects and in MEMO/09/35
on internet broadband infrastructure.
