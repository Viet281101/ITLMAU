IP/09/1883 Brussels, 7 December 2009 Commission launches on-line vote for the new EU Organic Logo Starting today, the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development invites all Europeans to cast their vote in the final stage of the EU organic logo competition. The website  http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/logo/index.htm  will host the online vote where the three final logos will be displayed until 31 January. The new logo aims to enhance consumer protection and promote organic farming. Unlike the current logo, the winning entry will be obligatory for all pre-packaged organic products that derive from the 27 Member States and meet the labelling standards. “Through this online vote, the European Commission wants to ensure that the new logo appeals to as many people as possible. At the same time, this open selection process contributes to the bigger objective of making people aware of the importance of the organic farming sector,” said Mariann Fischer Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development. The new logo needs to represent the EU both inside and outside its borders. It should be easy to remember and to associate with the EU and organic farming without using any words or letters. For this difficult task, the European Commission involved design and art students from all over Europe by launching the EU organic logo competition, which took place from April until June 2009. A total of 3,422 future designers submitted their innovative proposals. After the competition closed, an internationally renowned jury took the competition to the next stage by selecting the final three logos.
