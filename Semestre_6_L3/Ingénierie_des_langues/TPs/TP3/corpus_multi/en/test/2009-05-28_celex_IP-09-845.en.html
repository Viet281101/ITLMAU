IP/09/845 Brussels, 28 May 2009 Delivering real benefits for citizens across Europe: Commission achievements 2004-2009 The European Commission has today set out its record of achievement in advance of the European Parliament election. The European Commission has made the re-unified European Union work to the benefit of its citizens and has brought increased stability and prosperity to a Union of 27 Member States. It has responded decisively to the financial and economic crisis. It has implemented an integrated approach to fighting climate change and securing energy supply. The Commission has sought to shape globalisation so that it is inclusive, better regulated and reflects European values. The President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso stated: " This Commission, the first of an enlarged Union of 27 Member States, has faced some of the most challenging times the European Union has ever experienced, at a time of huge economic and social change. Our record shows that we have held fast to the core values and core goals that have made the Union so successful, and will leave a powerful contribution to the future development of the European project.  I am particularly proud of our response to the economic and financial crisis, our ambitious agenda to fight climate change and the creation of a real European energy policy. The European Union is now taking the lead in shaping globalisation with European values and in promoting the European interest worldwide. Now is the time for the European citizens to express their views for the future in the European Parliament elections. I call on Europe's citizens to make use of their democratic right." The record of achievement is set out in a comprehensive paper published today and available in all official EU languages. The Barroso Commission has built its credibility with citizens, economic operators, member states and the European Parliament over the last five years. It has shown that it can propose ambitious but realistic initiatives and make sure they are delivered. It has done all this in times of institutional change and economic crisis. Major new legislation has been agreed to put the Single Market firmly at the service of citizens, for instance through enhancing passenger rights in transport, cutting mobile phone charges or facilitating cross-border payments. At the same time, the Commission has simplified the EU rulebook, proposing to remove almost 10% of unnecessary legislation and reduce administrative burdens on business particularly on small and medium enterprises. The Commission's focus on growth and jobs through the renewed Lisbon strategy and the revised Stability and Growth Pact has put Europe in better shape to respond to the current economic, financial and employment crisis. The Commission was the first international institution to present a credible recovery plan and has led the response on impaired assets, recapitalisation, state aid and measures to move from rescue to recovery in specific sectors e.g. cars. The Commission is leading the fightback at the G-20 level and at European level through implementation of the recommendations of the de Larosière report. The Barroso Commission has led the paradigm shift in Europe's approach towards climate change and energy. With the ambitious package of legislative measures prepared by the Barroso Commission, Europe has shown itself ready to give leadership and will continue to do so in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate change talks. It ensures that short term measures, as a response to the economic crisis, are fully compatible with our longer term goals. The European Commission has worked hard to shape the changing global environment to address poverty, global health issues, migration and security issues. It has demonstrated its influence on the occasion of crises in Georgia, the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, it has invested in regional stability in its neighbourhood and has promoted effective and ambitious partnerships with global powers to defend the European interest and European values. Further work is required. The Doha Trade Round remains to be concluded and. Number of proposals to reform financial markets, to boost employment and to address other pressing challenges have been put on the table by the Commission but still await final EU approval. As we keep on managing the effects of the current economic crisis, the Commission will need to focus on making sure that the Union comes out stronger from it. It will remain focused on the need to ratify the Lisbon Treaty and this provides the Union with an increased capacity to act. The Barroso Commission has taken the initiative in proposing solutions to today's problems. The economic recovery plan, fighting climate change, energy security, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, I billion euro food facility for development, European Institute of Technology, 5 billion euro for energy projects and broadband for rural communities and the migration pact – all stem from the initiative of the Commission. The Commission has shown that the EU can work at 27, lead the debate and deliver results. The Commission has been in the engine room driving the European agenda forward. It has built the consensus of all 27 member states at each European Council through good and bad times. That is the legacy of this Commission. Background The Barroso Commission started its work on 22 November 2004. The mandate of the Commission is scheduled to end on 31 October 2009. Over the last four and a half years, the Commission has adopted ambitious legislative proposals. Since the start of 2005 the European Parliament and Council have successfully agreed over 470 proposals under the co-decision procedure.
