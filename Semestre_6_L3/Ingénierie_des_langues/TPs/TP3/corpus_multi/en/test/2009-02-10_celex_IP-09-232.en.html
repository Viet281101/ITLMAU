[Graphic in PDF & Word format]Social Networking: Commission brokers
agreement among major web companies17 leading web firms have signed for the first time
a European agreement to improve the safety of under 18s who use social
networking sites. These include Arto, Bebo, Dailymotion, Facebook, Giovani.it,
Google/YouTube, Hyves, Microsoft Europe, Myspace, Nasza-klaza.pl, Netlog,
One.lt, Skyrock, StudiVZ, Sulake/Habbo Hotel, Yahoo!Europe, and Zap.lu. Social
networking sites are an emerging social and economic phenomenon, attracting 41.7
million regular users in Europe and changing the way we interact with each other
on the Web. The use of social networks has grown over the past year by 35% in
Europe and is expected to more than double to 107.4 million users by 2012. To
make sure that social networks continue to grow, young users need to feel safe
when expanding their networks or sharing any personal information. The agreement
signed today in Luxembourg at the Safer Internet Day organised by the European
Commission will empower teenagers to deal with potential risks they may face
online, like cyberbullying or revealing personal information.
"The Commission applauds this first European agreement on Social
Networking. It is an important step forward towards making our children's clicks
on social networking sites safer in Europe," said Viviane Reding, EU
Commissioner for Information Society and Media. "Social networking has
enormous potential to flourish in Europe, to help boost our economy and make our
society more interactive – as long as children and teenagers have the
trust and the right tools to remain safe when making new 'friends' and sharing
personal details online. I will closely monitor the implementation of today's
agreement and the Commission will come back to this matter in a year's
time."
Today, Europe's major social networking sites have come together for the
first time at this year's Safer Internet Day to recognise their responsibility
and identify potential risks on their sites for under 18s. These include
cyberbullying (harassing children on internet sites or via mobile messages),
grooming (when an adult befriends a child with the intention of committing
sexual abuse) and risky behaviour like revealing personal information. They aim
to limit these risks by:Providing an easy to use and accessible "report abuse" button,
allowing users to report inappropriate contact from or conduct by another user
with one click.
Making sure that the full online profiles and contact lists of website users
who are registered as under 18s are set to "private" by default.
This will make it harder for people with bad intentions to get in touch with the
young person.
Ensuring that private profiles of users under the age of 18 are
not searchable (on the websites or via search engines)
Guaranteeing that privacy options are prominent and accessible
at all times, so that users can easily work out if just their friends, or the
entire world, can see what they post online.
Preventing under-age users from using their services: if a social
networking site targets teenagers over 13, it should be difficult for people
below that age to register.Social networking sites will inform the
Commission about their individual safety policies and how they will put these
principles in place by April 2009. 
Background:
Today's agreement is the result of discussions in the Social Networking Task
Force set up by the European Commission in April 2008. This group brought
together social networking sites, NGOs and researchers, and is a good example of
industry self-regulation, an approach favoured by the Commission if effectively
implemented. 
Similar initiatives in this area include the Social Networking guidance from
UK Home Office of April 2008, and separate agreements between Myspace, and
Facebook with 49 State Attorneys General in the United Sates. 
Safer Internet Day has been organised every year since 2004 and includes
events in more than 50 countries in Europe and worldwide.
Safer Internet Day 2007, on the initiative of Commissioner Reding, resulted
in an agreement on safer mobile use by young teenagers signed by all major
mobile operators (IP/07/139).
