technologies for language learning; and terminology
"India's experience in coping with linguistic diversity is unique in the
world and I believe that the EU and India can learn from each other in this
area" said Leonard Orban, European Commissioner for Multilingualism
This Joint Declaration is a follow-up to the EU-India Summit in Marseilles on
29 September 2008, where EU and Indian leaders committed themselves to
developing a dialogue on the promotion of languages, intercultural dialogue and
multilingualism. 
A first step towards this dialogue was achieved in December 2008 with the
conference on "Multilingualism and Cultural Dialogue in Globalisation" that took
place in New Delhi, India, in the context of the 2008 European Year of
Intercultural Dialogue. The Conference was organised jointly by the European
Commission, the French Embassy, under its Presidency of the European Union, the
Indian National Knowledge Commission and the European Union of National
Institutes for Culture (EUNIC-India Cluster). The University of Delhi graciously
hosted the Conference on its premises. For more information on the Conference
please see 
http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/news/news3134_en.htmWith a population of approximately 1.1 billion people, India represents a
unique example of ethnic, socio-cultural and religious diversity that brings
with it a very rich linguistic diversity. According to the 2001 Census Report,
there are 29 languages spoken by more than a million native speakers, 122
languages with at least 10,000 speakers and another 234 languages spoken by a
smaller number. The Indian Constitution declares Hindi to be the
official language of the union. English may be used for official
purposes and the country has 22 official regional languages. This rich
linguistic diversity has been a fact of life throughout India's history and it
is considered locally to be quite natural.
This similarity in the linguistic landscape with the European Union makes
India a privileged interlocutor for Europe in the field of multilingualism. This
Joint Declaration makes provision for regular debate and exchange of good
practices.
