Brussels, 8 May 2009World-class Cohesion Policy: Commissioner
Hübner addresses first high-level conference on regional governance in a
global contextOn 11 May, Regional Policy Commissioner Danuta
Hübner will be the keynote speaker at a conference in Brussels focusing on
"Regional Governance in a Global Context". The first event of its kind, the
conference will gather 300 participants including presidents of European regions
and representatives of Brazil, Russia, China, Canada, Paraguay, Senegal, Burkina
Faso and other countries, together with regional organisations such as OLAGI
(Intermediate Governments of Latin America) and the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU). The aim of the event is to look at the
experience of the EU's Cohesion Policy and similar policies in other parts of
the world, in the context of a growing interest in the policy within the EU's
external relations. A key theme will be how to organise more effective systems
of governance to ensure that regional development policies achieve their maximum
impact.
Ahead of the conference, Commissioner Hübner stated: “Countries
worldwide face similar challenges, not least the global economic crisis, but
also due to ageing populations, the risks posed by climate change and concerns
over energy security. In the European Union, we are developing partnerships with
countries outside the EU which deliver benefits for both parties. We see that
many countries are showing a growing interest in the EU's Cohesion Policy model
and its success in fostering balanced regional development and opportunities.
This conference provides an excellent opportunity to share experiences and learn
from each other."  
This two-day conference is organised by the European Commission's
Directorate-General for Regional Policy in co-operation with the
Directorate-General for Development, the Committee of the Regions and the Forum
of Global Associations of Regions (FOGAR). As well as examining the EU's
experience in the field of Cohesion Policy, the conference will look at
different models of development, at ways of sharing experience in cross-border
co-operation, and the role of European regions in fostering partnerships with
regions elsewhere.
Drawing on experience of Europe's Cohesion Policy
In her speech, Commissioner Hübner will recall the fundamental premise
of Cohesion Policy, that is, to promote economic and social cohesion by reducing
disparities in levels of development between Member States and regions. While
this remains the primary role of the policy, the challenges faced by Europe's
regions have changed over time and the Commissioner will underline how EU policy
has evolved to meet the new realities and to deliver a more strategic, effective
response.
She will stress how the new challenges of globalisation, climate change and
demographic change have a strong 'territorial' dimension that requires action at
local and regional level. Commissioner Hübner will also highlight key
Cohesion Policy successes as well as some of the lessons learned in implementing
the policy, which may be useful for countries outside Europe. 
The conference is divided into three workshops: The first, "Regional
responses to global challenges", will focus on the contribution of different
regional governance systems to development programmes, both inside and outside
the EU. The second, "The role of regional co-operation in a globalised
world", will explore the growing involvement of Europe’s
regions in the development of cities and regions in the rest of the world, and
examine how regional networks can contribute to development and sustainability.
The final session, entitled "Regional inequalities within emerging
countries", will examine the scale of inequalities in different parts of the
world and assess whether a geographically based approach, such as the EU's
Cohesion Policy, is the most effective means of addressing such inequalities.Note for editors
The EU has signed bilateral agreements with China, Russia and Brazil to
strengthen regional policy cooperation and is due to sign a similar accord with
Ukraine in the near future. Shared interests include instruments to support
innovation-driven regional development, classification and definition of
regions, and spatial planning. 
The European Parliament has also recently agreed financing (€2 million)
for a pilot project to promote Cohesion Policy on a global scale.
