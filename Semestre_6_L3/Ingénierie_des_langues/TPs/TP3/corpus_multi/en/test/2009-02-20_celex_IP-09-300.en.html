Brussels, 20 February 2009Five years of an enlarged EU has brought
lasting benefits and left Europe better placed to tackle the current
crisisThe recent enlargements of the European Union were
a milestone in the process of unifying Europe and have brought benefits to
citizens throughout the Union. Economically, enlargement has led to increased
living standards in the new Member States, while creating export and investment
opportunities for the old ones. It has also helped consolidate democracy,
stability and security on our continent.  An enlarged EU carries more weight
when addressing issues of global importance be it climate change or the world
economy and its governance. Five years on the EU is not only bigger, it is also
stronger, more dynamic and culturally richer. In the current difficult global
context, the big challenge is to resist any temptation  of protectionist
tendencies that would destroy the huge benefits for citizens brought about by
the creation of a border free single market of 500 million people.“The 2004 and 2007 enlargements were a huge historic step. They put
an end to the division of Europe, helped consolidate democracy and brought
economic benefits for all EU countries in terms of higher competitiveness,
higher economic growth and higher job creation. We should not let the crisis
overshadow this uncontested success. United, we can shape the solution to global
issues such as climate change or a new international financial governance.
Divided we will achieve nothing," said Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner Joaquín Almunia
Olli Rehn, Enlargement Commissioner added:" Enlargement has served as an
anchor of stability, and driver of democracy and the rule of law in Europe.
Economically it has benefitted both new and old member states, as well as the EU
as a whole. It has extended the area of peace and prosperity to almost 500
million people and increased our weight in the world."
It has been five years since the EU took in 10 new
Members[1[1]] from Central and
Eastern Europe, putting an end to several decades of division brought about by
the Cold War. Two others, Bulgaria and Romania, joined in 2007. A Communication
on “Five Years of an Enlarged EU" shows that the enlargement brought about
huge economic benefits for both sides.  
The enlarged EU is now the largest integrated economic area in the world,
accounting for more than 30% of world GDP and more than 17% of world trade. This
enables the EU to be a decisive player in a global world.  It can make its voice
heard in shaping globalisation for the benefit of citizens.
Income per capita in new Member States has risen from 40% of the old Member
States' average in 1999 to 52% in 2008 and growth averaged 5.5% from 2004-2008
compared to 3.5 % in 1999-2003. But this has not been at the expense of old
Member States, whose growth was around 2.2% annually from 2004-2008, with a
similar figure for 1999-2003. 
Enlargement also increased trade opportunities. In 2007, almost 80% of
exports of the new Member States went to the rest of the EU. Old Member States
also saw their sales to the new members increase to around 7.5% of their total
exports in 2007, from 4 ¾ % a decade ago.Unemployment in new Member States has declined from often very high levels to
levels similar to those in the rest of the EU – around 7% in 2007.
Concerns in old Member States about massive labour migration have not
materialised. In most host Member States the number of migrant workers has not
exceeded 1% of the "home" working age population and enabled labour shortages to
be filled. Temporariness has been a strong feature of most of this migration
– in the UK 50% of recent migrants have returned to their countries of
origin.
The current global crisis is creating difficulties for all countries,
including in the EU, and unemployment is rising everywhere.  
But a big, united EU is better able to address this and other challenges than
if its member states act alone. The EU has taken coordinated action to stabilise
the banking system and to help the economic recovery. These measures, completed
by others under preparation, more importantly to restore the crucial credit
channel to the economy, allow us to envisage a gradual recovery from the end of
this year.
New Member States currently experiencing a sharp growth slowdown are
supported by the significant funds available under the EU's Cohesion Policy. The
Balance of Payments facility allows the EU to come to the rescue of Member
States outside the euro area that need temporary assistance. 
The common competition and state aid rules will ensure a level playing field
for firms.
The Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs helps identify those reforms that
will increase our economies' growth potential and will make them more resilient
in the face of global shocks.
The Commission is working with Member States to re-programme the European
Social Fund to help keep people in employment in Member States old and new.  The
Commission is also working to reduce the broader social impact of the crisis
including through the Globalization Adjustment Fund.
The reformed Stability and Growth Pact provides a solid framework that allows
us to stimulate demand and job creation in the short term, while holding the
course for sound and sustainable public finances in the medium and long-term.Full Communication and analytical report available on:
