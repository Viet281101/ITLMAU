Brussels, 08 April 2009Commission updates the list of airlines
banned from European airspaceThe European Commission
today adopted the update of the so-called blacklist of airlines that are banned
from flying into the European Union due to safety concerns. The Commission has
imposed a ban on six airlines from Kazakhstan, one airline certified in
Thailand, one additional Ukrainian air carrier and on operations of all carriers
certified in Benin.
"The Commission will continue to actively pursue a dialogue with everyone
involved in aviation to ensure that all aircraft and air carriers conform to
internationally required levels of air safety. Air passengers are entitled to
feel safe and be safe when their plane takes off," said Antonio Tajani,
Commission Vice-President in charge of transport.
The new list, which replaces the previous one published in November 2008, can
be consulted on the Commission’s
website[1]. Following the unanimous
opinion of the Air Safety Committee, the Commission updated the list and decided
to expand the list and impose an operating ban for safety reasons on the
following air carriers:Air Company Kokshetau, ATMA Airlines, Berkut Air, East Wing, Sayat Air and
Starline KZ (Kazakhstan) 
One Two Go Airlines (Thailand)
Motor Sich Airlines (Ukraine)
All airlines certified in the Republic of Benin on the basis of the negative
results of an audit by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
The Commission noted good progress in relation to the measures
taken by Angola in order to improve the safety situation. In particular, it took
note of the progress report drawn up by the aviation authorities of Angola on
the implementation of corrective actions following the visit of a team of
European experts in February 2008 and the publication of the ICAO safety audit
report in October 2008. 
A report of the visit of a European team of experts to Indonesia in February
2009 showed considerable improvements. The Commission will continue close
consultations with the aviation authorities with a view to re-assessing the
safety situation at the next meeting of the Air Safety Committee.
Hence from today the Community list imposes a ban on:All carriers from Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz
Republic, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and Gabon save for Gabon Airlines and Afrijet, which have exemptions for a
small number of aircraft.
