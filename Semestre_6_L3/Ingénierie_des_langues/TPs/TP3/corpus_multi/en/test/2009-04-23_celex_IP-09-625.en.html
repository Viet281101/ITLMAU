Brussels, 23 April 2009EU reinforces ties with its neighbours and
continues to support their reformsIn its annual Progress Reports, the European
Commission takes stock of the concrete reform achievements made by countries
within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) in 2008 and identifies the areas
where further efforts are needed. In a policy paper on the implementation of the
ENP presented today, the Commission provides an overview of developments in 12
ENP countries. It also highlights the impact of the financial crisis on them and
proposes a number of ways the EU could contribute to their recovery process.
Despite a difficult context in 2008, marked by political and economic challenges
and an overall slowdown of reform momentum notably in the field of governance,
many achievements have been registered by the partner countries in key areas of
cooperation such as much closer political contacts, increased trade, deeper
cooperation on research and innovation, more youth mobility, etc. Ties were also
substantially strengthened through two new regional frameworks which complement
the differentiated bilateral relations: the Union for the Mediterranean and the
Eastern Partnership. Individual country reports for each country with an ENP
Action Plan[1]
and a sectoral report accompany the policy paper.
“The year 2008 has clearly demonstrated the strategic importance of
the European Neighbourhood Policy. The economic and financial crisis, violent
conflicts in our neighbourhood and political instability all impact on the
security and prosperity of EU citizens. Therefore, it remains crucial for the EU
to provide tangible, targeted and credible support to our neighbours to create
mutual security and prosperity dividends" said Benita Ferrero-Waldner,
Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy. 
Despite a generally difficult context (global economic and financial crisis,
conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008, Israel's intervention in
Gaza in December 2008/January 2009), the EU’s relations with its
neighbours have further intensified in 2008. Europe's partners have shown
progress in reforming their economies and providing better opportunities for
their societies through modernisation efforts.
Benita Ferrero-Waldner added: "Despite the difficult international context in
2008, the ENP has continued to yield results and was further deepened by two new
initiatives: the Union for the Mediterranean and the Eastern Partnership. Our
partners have made considerable progress in key areas, such as trade, taxation
and a better business environment, but need to do significantly more especially
on political reforms, good governance and human rights. The ENP will therefore
continue to serve as the EU's instrument to encourage reforms in its immediate
neighbourhood."
Political cooperation was strengthenedArmenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine aligned themselves
with the vast majority of the Common Foreign and Security Policy declarations
with which they were invited to align, speaking with the EU in one voice in the
international arena.
The European Commission co-chaired a donor conference for the
Palestinians (with a pledge of €440 million in 2008) and
supports political stabilization and national reconciliation (electoral reform)
in Lebanon.
The EU played a crucial role in agreeing a cease-fire in Georgia
during the armed conflict with Russia, supported its territorial integrity,
rapidly sent EU observers on the ground, provided immediate humanitarian aid for
internally displaced persons and sponsored the Geneva talks for resolution of
the conflict. The EC co-chaired an international donor conference for Georgia,
and pledged  up to €500 million for the period
2008-2010).Economic integration and trade exchanges were
boostedUkraine joined the World Trade Organisation and is negotiating with
the EU a deep and comprehensive Free Trade Agreement within the context of the

trade agreements with Georgia and Armenia have been
concluded.

Tunisia. Negotiations on the liberalisation of services and establishment

Moldova entered into force on 1 January 2008.

the aim of establishing a visa free regime as a long term perspective.   .A
dialogue with Georgia was strengthened with a view to conclude visa
facilitation and readmission agreements and launching a Mobility Partnership to
facilitate legal migration while combating illegal migration. Such a Mobility
Partnership was launched with Moldova in mid-2008.
Political dialogue and security co-operation on fight against illegal
migration was deepened with Morocco. 
Tunisia upgraded its equipment and infrastructure to
strengthen border control and adopted new biometric passports, nevertheless
illegal immigration of Tunisian origin increased significantly in
2008.Cooperation on justiceThe conditions for training of Palestinian judges and prosecutors
were improved by the establishment of the EC-funded Palestinian Judicial
Training Institute. Specialized training for judges, lawyers and clerks is being
prepared in Lebanon. 
The Commission supplied vehicles to the Palestinian Civil Police

corruption, improved detention conditions and the combat of torture and ill-
treatment.

cooperation entered into new phaseNegotiations were launched on accession of Moldova and
Ukraine to the Energy Community Treaty, which includes commitments

energy security by upgrading soviet-type reactors. The EC continue to assist
Armenia financially in ensuring minimum safety standards in

The Union for the Mediterranean Summit in 13 July 2008 endorsed the
Mediterranean Solar Plan as a priority initiative for the Union for the
Mediterranean: Barcelona Process.Transport links are
strengthenedThe air transport agreement with Morocco since 2007 has lead to an
increase of the traffic by 17% so far with creation of 52 new connection lines
and entry on the market of 12 new air companies. It reduces fares and improves
choice for tourists, while helping to build tourist industry and provide
employment. Negotiations on a similar agreement were launched with
Ukraine and are planned with Georgia. 
Horizontal air transport agreements were signed with Armenia,
Israel and Jordan and negotiations on Euro-Mediterranean
aviation agreements with the last two countries were launched.
In South Caucasus rehabilitation of the Yerevan-Tbilisi

Georgia following war with Russia and to help Ukraine and

well as marked increase in exchanges for young people and youth workers
(+23%).Building on the Barcelona Process, the Union for the
Mediterranean has given renewed vigour to Europe’s relationship with
its Southern neighbours. The European Commission has also proposed an ambitious
Eastern Partnership with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova
and Ukraine, offering a wide and ambitious agenda for deepening the EU's ties to
these countries.
