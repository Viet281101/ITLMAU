Strasbourg, 22 April 2009Cost of roaming texts, calls and data
services to plummet from 1 JulyA text message sent from abroad in the EU will cost
no more than €0.11 as of 1 July, instead of €0.28 today. The times
where consumers had to expect "bill shocks" for downloading a picture or a movie
with a mobile phone while roaming in the EU are over. The European Parliament,
in its plenary session in Strasbourg, today voted by a large majority in favour
of new EU rules on SMS and data roaming, proposed by the European Commission in
September 2008 (IP/08/1386).
The Parliament also voted for further cuts in the price of mobile phone calls
while roaming in another EU country. The present cap for a mobile phone call
made abroad will progressively drop from €0.46 to €0.35 per minute
by July 2011, and from €0.22 today to €0.11 for mobile calls
received while roaming abroad. Mobile operators will also be required to bill
roaming calls by the second from the 31st
second at the latest, which will end the current practice under which consumers
are overcharged by up to 24%. As the Council of EU Telecoms Ministers has
already signalled its agreement with the new roaming rules, today's vote paves
the way for an entry into force of the new rules just in time for the summer
holidays. European consumers are expected to save up to 60% on their bill for
using a mobile phone abroad in the EU. 
"I welcome the strong support the European Parliament has today given the
Commission's proposal for creating a single telecoms markets for all Europeans,
whether they are crossing a border as tourists or as business travellers,"
said José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission. "After
this vote, Europe is now clearly the most attractive continent in the world for
mobile phone users. I expect this to translate very swiftly into even stronger
growth for mobile data services in the EU."
"Today's vote marks the definite end of the roaming rip off in Europe,"
said EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding. "Thanks to the strong
support of the European Parliament and the Council, the new roaming rules were
agreed in the record time of just 7 months. Just in time for the summer
holidays, European citizens will now be able to see the single market without
borders on their phone bills."
"In times of economic downturn, strengthening the purchasing power of
consumers is a strong instrument for a speedy recovery," said Consumer
Commissioner Meglena Kuneva. "This is why today's vote will empower consumers
and further stimulate the take up of mobile telephony in Europe."
The new EU roaming rules endorsed by the Parliament today will:cap the price that consumers can be charged for sending a text
message while abroad at €0.11 (excluding VAT), compared to a current
average of €0.28 (with prices per roamed SMS above €0.35 in the
Netherlands and in Portugal). 
substantially reduce data roaming charges (the cost of surfing the
web or downloading movies with a mobile phone while abroad) by introducing a
wholesale cap of €1 per megabyte downloaded, compared to an
average wholesale price of € 1.68 per megabyte, with peaks in Ireland
(€6.82), Greece (€5.30) and in Estonia (€5.10). The wholesale
cap will fall to €0.80 in 2010 and to €0.50 in 2011.
protect consumers from "bill shocks" by allowing customers to choose
a cut-off mechanism once the bill reaches €50, unless the consumer
opts for a higher limit. Operators will have until March 2010 to put these
transparency measures in place. Recently, a German consumer who downloaded a TV
programme while roaming in France was faced with a bill of €46,000.
further reduce price caps for mobile roaming calls. Now at
€0.46 for calls made and €0.22 for calls received abroad, the caps
will go down to €0.43 for calls made and €0.19 for calls received
abroad on 1 July 2009, to €0.39 and €0.15 on 1 July 2010 and to
€0.35 and €0.11 by 1 July 2011 (all prices per minute, excluding
VAT).
introduce the principle of per-second billing after the first 30
seconds for roamed calls made and from the first second for calls received while
abroad. At present, consumers are paying around 20% more than the time they
actually consume when making or receiving calls.Following today's
Parliament vote, the new EU Roaming Regulation will become directly applicable
law throughout all 27 EU Member States on 1 July 2009. 
The new roaming rules, which add to a first EU regulation on voice roaming
adopted in 2007 (IP/07/870),
will apply until summer 2012. The European Parliament has asked the Commission
to report on the functioning of the new rules again by summer 2010. The
Commission could then propose further rules, if required, by the end of June
2011. "The development of the roaming market will be kept under close EU
scrutiny over the next three years", said Commissioner Reding. "I very
much hope that the mobile industry will understand this message. The ball is now
in their court if they want to show that there can be healthy competition in the
roaming market. The best proof of this would be if attractive voice and data
roaming packages appear on the market very soon.”
Background: 
Since the present European Commission took office, the use of mobile
telephony in the EU grew from 84.6% to 119% of the population (IP/09/473).
The EU's telecoms market counts 500 million potential users of fixed and
mobile telephony, Internet broadband and mobile data services. To solve
structural problems of competition and regulatory consistency within this market
and to stimulate new investment, the European Parliament, in its May plenary
session, is expected to vote on a major reform of the EU's telecoms rules
initiated by the Commission in November 2007 (IP/07/1677,
MEMO/07/458,
IP/08/1661).The new rules include the establishment of a European Telecoms Regulator
called "BEREC" (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications) by
January 2010.
