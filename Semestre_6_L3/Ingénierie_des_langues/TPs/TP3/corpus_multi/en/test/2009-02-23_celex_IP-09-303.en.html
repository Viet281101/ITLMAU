Brussels, 23 February 2009Commission focuses on disaster prevention
and reduction of risks at home and abroadThe European Commission today adopted two
Communications related to disasters: a Community approach to reducing the impact
of natural and man-made disasters within the EU, and a strategy for supporting
disaster risk reduction in developing countries. The Communications, adopted as
a package, represent a first attempt to establish a more strategic approach.
Proposed action at Community level focuses on areas where a common approach is
more effective than separate national approaches, such as developing knowledge,
linking actors and policies, and improving the performance of existing Community
disaster prevention instruments. With regard to developing countries, the
Commission is setting out an EU strategy to help reduce the impact of natural
disasters on countries considered to be high-risk. Both Communications
contribute to the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for action 2005-2015,
adopted at the world conference on disaster reduction. 
European Commissioner for Environment Stavros Dimas said: "Natural disasters
are a growing threat for EU Member States, and they are predicted to increase in
frequency and magnitude over the coming years. We must do all we can in order to
reduce their impact by being prepared as best as we can. This Communication is
an important first step launching a long term process for Community action in
this field."
European Commissioner for development and humanitarian aid Louis Michel said:
"Disasters are shattering the lives of poor people all over the globe. We know
that prevention is better than cure. Investing in the reduction of risks before
a disaster takes place pays huge dividends in comparison to providing
humanitarian aid afterwards. I believe that disaster risk reduction is a key
element in the fight against poverty across the globe." 
Prevention:  added value at EU level
The prevention Communication identifies areas where action at the EU level
could provide added value. These include: establishing a Community-level
inventory of existing information and best practices; developing guidelines on
hazard and risk mapping; linking actors and policies throughout the disaster
management cycle with more training and awareness-raising; improved access to
early warning systems; and more efficient targeting of community funds.
Disaster Risk Reduction: a must for sustainable poverty reduction
The disaster risk reduction Communication sets out the following action
priorities:strengthening of political dialogue with developing countries; 
integration of disaster risk reduction into both EU and developing
countries' policy and action, including EU support for national risk reduction
investments;
development of regional plans, starting with one for the Caribbean: such
action plans would include for example support for awareness-raising
campaigns.The EU will set out all the specific actions foreseen in
an implementation plan foreseen for June 2009.
Background
In March 2008, the Commission adopted a Communication on reinforcing the
Union’s Disaster Response capacity (COM(2008)130). It took an integrated
approach encompassing all stages of disasters (prevention, preparation,
immediate response, recovery), addressing all types of disasters (inside or
outside the EU, natural or man-made), and covering all EU instruments as well as
inter-institutional coordination. It also included a specific annex on forest
fires. The Communication announced the two proposals on prevention and on an EU
strategy for disaster risk reduction in developing countries. Furthermore, the
European Parliament and the Council have both called for urgent action in the
area of disaster prevention.
The economic cost of disasters in Europe is estimated to be €15
billion.
Disasters hit developing countries hardest, as they are the most vulnerable
and have the least capacity to cope. They also undermine and jeopardize the
achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The eight goals
include the target to halve the proportion of people living on less than 1 US
Dollar a day and get every child primary education by 2015 (http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals
).
Under the 2005 Hyogo Framework for Action – an international framework
on disaster risk reduction – states should work jointly on the issue.
