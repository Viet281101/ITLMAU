Brussels, 17 February 2009Launching the first EU health prize for
journalists, part of the Europe for Patients campaignToday, the European Commission launches the first
EU health prize for journalists in print and on-line articles. This prestigious
prize is an important component of the recently launched Europe for Patients
campaign. The prize serves as both recognition and promotion of high quality
health journalism across Europe. It serves to stimulate and contribute to the
debate on EU health issues, specifically those initiatives related to the Europe
for patients' campaign. 
Androulla Vassiliou, EU Commissioner for Health said: "The prize
recognises the crucial role and responsibility of journalists in communicating
EU health polices and actions to the citizens of Europe. The initiatives adopted
under the Europe for Patients campaign - such as cancer screening, patient
safety, organ donation and transplantation, use of antibiotics and cross border
healthcare affect us all and reflect the Commission's priority of putting the
citizen first. I hope this prize will stimulate debate at local, national and
European level."   
Articles published in print or on-line publications between 2 July 2008, when
the first Europe for Patients initiative was adopted, and the closing date of 15
June 2009 will be considered. Journalists are invited to submit their articles
using the on-line entry form on the Europe for Patients website. Further details
on the rules and conditions are available on the website.
The selection of the winner will be a two step procedure. First, national
juries chaired by the Commission's Representation and composed of 2 health
experts and 2 journalists will select a national finalist from each Member
State.  The second step is choosing the winner and 2 runners up. This is the
role of the EU jury, chaired by the European Commission's Director General for
Health and Consumers, Mr Robert Madelin. The names of the national and EU jury,
when confirmed, will be published on the Europe for Patients website. 
The 27 finalists will be invited to Brussels in autumn 2009 for a media
seminar on EU health issues and a prestigious award ceremony hosted by
Commissioner Vassiliou. The first prize will be 5,000 EUR, the second prize
3,000 EUR and the third prize 2,000 EUR. 
The EU health prize for journalists and the Europe for Patients Campaign are
funded under the Second Community Health Programme 2008-2013.
The EU health prize is intended as an annual event while its scope will be
eventually broadened to cover also audio-visual media. This will depend on the
success and lessons learned from this first year.
