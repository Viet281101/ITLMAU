Brussels, 3 April 2009.eu: three years on, three million domain
namesThree years after its launch, the .eu top-level
internet domain continues to be a success story. There are now more than three
million internet domains under Europe's own top-level domain. Even the financial
crisis has not stopped this growth: the number of .eu domains increased by 2%
during the first quarter of 2009, and .eu was firmly entrenched as the fifth
most popular country code top-level domain worldwide. By promoting a distinctly
European online identity .eu can help citizens and businesses to reap the full
benefits of Europe's single market. Multinational companies and SMEs, NGOs,
think tanks as well as citizens have all adopted .eu to mark their web presence.
They are not the only ones. Early last month, Sweden made a
symbolic gesture by being the first Member State to adopt ".eu" for its official
website dedicated to the Presidency of the European Union that will start on 1
July: www.se2009.eu.
"I welcome the fact that Sweden has decided to choose a .eu domain for
their presidency of the European Union that will start on 1 July. This is an
encouraging sign which will hopefully be followed by many presidencies in the
future," said Viviane Reding, the EU's Commissioner for Information Society
and Media. "By choosing a .eu domain name for its website, the presidency can
clearly show that the chairmanship is not about the country that presides over
meetings for 6 months, but about working for the whole of Europe. This also
shows that .eu, which celebrates its third birthday today, is becoming the
natural choice for anyone seeking a European online identity."
.eu has consolidated its place among the ten largest top-level domains in the
world, such as .com, .net. and .org. Registrations for .eu domains have grown
every year since its introduction three years ago, on 7 April 2006 (IP/06/476),
reaching the three million mark earlier this year (IP/09/48).
Nearly 3,050,000 .eu domains had been registered by March 2009.
Most .eu domains have been registered in EU countries with the largest
populations and highest internet take up as a proportion of population. Germany
continues to lead with 30%, followed by the Netherlands (14%), the United
Kingdom (12%), France (8%) and Poland (6%). 
Background
.eu first opened on 7 December 2005 to holders of prior rights including
trade mark holders and public bodies (IP/05/1510).
Since early April 2006, registration has been open to all EU residents and
organisations established in the EU (IP/06/476).
Management of the .eu registry (the database holding all .eu registrations) is
entrusted to EURid, an independent
not-for-profit organisation. By its first anniversary, 2.5 million .eu domain
names had been registered (IP/07/483),
another 300,000 domain names were added in 2007 (IP/08/530).
