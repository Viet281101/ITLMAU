Brussels, 14 April 2009Telecoms: Commission launches case against
UK over privacy and personal data protectionThe Commission has opened an infringement
proceeding against the United Kingdom after a series of complaints by UK
internet users, and extensive communication of the Commission with UK
authorities, about the use of a behavioural advertising technology known as
‘Phorm' by internet service providers. The proceeding addresses several
problems with the UK's implementation of EU ePrivacy and personal data
protection rules, under which EU countries must ensure, among other things, the
confidentiality of communications by prohibiting interception and surveillance
without the user's consent. These problems emerged during the Commission’s
inquiry into the UK authorities’ action in response to complaints from
internet users concerning Phorm.
“Technologies like internet behavioural advertising can be useful
for businesses and consumers but they must be used in a way that complies with
EU rules. These rules are there to protect the privacy of citizens and must be
rigorously enforced by all Member States," said EU Telecoms Commissioner
Viviane Reding. “We have been following the Phorm case for some time
and have concluded that there are problems in the way the UK has implemented
parts of EU rules on the confidentiality of communications. I call on the UK
authorities to change their national laws and ensure that national authorities
are duly empowered and have proper sanctions at their disposal to enforce EU
legislation on the confidentiality of communications. This should allow the UK
to respond more vigorously to new challenges to ePrivacy and personal data
protection such as those that have arisen in the Phorm case. It should also help
reassure UK consumers about their privacy and data protection while surfing the
internet.”
Since April 2008, the Commission has received several questions from UK
citizens and UK Members of the European Parliament concerned about the use of a
behavioural advertising technology known as ‘Phorm’ by Internet
Service Providers in the UK. Phorm technology works by constantly analysing
customers' web surfing to determine users' interests and then deliver targeted
advertising to users when they visit certain websites. In April 2008, the UK
fixed operator, BT, admitted that it had tested Phorm in 2006 and 2007 without
informing customers involved in the trial. BT carried out a new,
invitation-based, trial of the technology in October-December 2008. BT’s
trials resulted in a number of complaints to the UK data protection authority
– the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and to the UK
police.
The Commission has written several letters to the UK authorities since July
2008, asking how they have implemented relevant EU laws in the context of the
Phorm case. Following an analysis of the answers received the Commission has
concerns that there are structural problems in the way the UK has implemented EU
rules ensuring the confidentiality of communications.
Under UK law, which is enforced by the UK police, it is an offence to
unlawfully intercept communications. However, the scope of this offence is
limited to ‘intentional’ interception only. Moreover, according to
this law, interception is also considered to be lawful when the interceptor has
‘reasonable grounds for believing’ that consent to interception has
been given. The Commission is also concerned that the UK does not have an
independent national supervisory authority dealing with such interceptions. 
The UK has two months to reply to this first stage of an infringement
proceeding, the letter of formal notice sent today. If the Commission receives
no reply, or if the observations presented by the UK are not satisfactory, the
Commission may decide to issue a reasoned opinion (the second stage in an
infringement proceeding). If the UK still fails to fulfil its obligations under
EU law after that, the Commission will refer the case to the European Court of
Justice.
Background
The EU Directive on privacy and electronic communications requires EU Member
States to ensure confidentiality of the communications and related traffic data
by prohibiting unlawful interception and surveillance unless the users concerned
have consented (Article 5(1) of Directive
2002/58/EC). The EU Data Protection Directive specifies that user consent
must be ‘freely given specific and informed’ (Article 2(h) of Directive
95/46/EC). Moreover, Article 24 of the Data Protection Directive requires
Member States to establish appropriate sanctions in case of infringements and
Article 28 says that independent authorities must be charged with supervising
implementation. These provisions of the Data Protection Directive also apply in
the area of confidentiality of communications.
