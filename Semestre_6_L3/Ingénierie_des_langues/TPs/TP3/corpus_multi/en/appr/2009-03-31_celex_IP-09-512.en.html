Brussels, 31 March 2009TEN-T 2009 Calls for Proposals: Nearly
€1 billion available in Trans-European Transport Network
fundingThe European Commission launched today the 2009
TEN-T Calls for Proposals, making nearly €1 billion of financing available
for European transport infrastructure projects. This year's Calls include a
€500 million call in the framework of the Commission's European Economic
Recovery Plan, aimed at giving an immediate boost to the European economy by
accelerating investments in infrastructure. In addition, there will be  funding
opportunities under the TEN-T Annual Programme and Multi-Annual Programme, whose
priorities in this Call include Motorways of the Sea, Intelligent Transport
Systems for Road, and the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). The
Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency (TEN-T EA), which manages the
technical and financial implementation of the TEN-T programme, is responsible
for the management of the calls for proposals and the evaluation of project
proposals submitted on behalf of its "parent", DG Energy and Transport.Commission Vice President Antonio Tajani, responsible for transport, noted "I
am convinced that stimulating economic demand with an ambitious programme of
European infrastructure is one of the most tangible and efficient responses that
we can give to today's economic crisis. This programme is TEN-T, and its
implementation will ensure job security for many Europeans in important sectors
such as construction, which is - and always has been - a major employer and
contributor to GDP. For this reason, the Commission, in the framework of the
European Economic Recovery Plan, has decided to bring forward €500 million
of funds as part of this year's TEN-T funding opportunities." 
This year's Calls for Proposals have been established under three separate
work programmes: 
1. €500 million of TEN-T funds have been brought forward under the
European Economic Recovery Plan, as a response to the economic and
financial crisis facing Europe. This ad hoc work programme, adopted this
year, supports works which can start in 2009 or 2010 and be largely
implemented over this two-year period. 
2. The Multi-annual Work Programme aims to finance the highest
priorities of the TEN-T network. This year's Call focuses on three fields:Motorways of the Sea (TEN-T Priority Project 21), providing viable
alternatives for congested roads by shifting freight to sea routes: maximum
€30 million
European Rail Traffic Management Systems (ERTMS), harmonising European rail
signalling systems: maximum €240 million
Intelligent Transport Systems for Roads (ITS Roads), using the integration
of information and communications technology to create more efficient and safer
road transport: maximum €100 million3. The flexible Annual
Work Programme (€140 million) complements the efforts developed
under the Multi-annual Work Programme. It includes an amount of €
60 million for the Loan Guarantee Instrument, which represents the Commission's
annual contribution. It will be made available to the European Investment Bank
(EIB). 
Potential applicants are invited to submit proposals by 15 May 2009, which
will be evaluated on their relevance to TEN-T priorities and policy objectives,
their maturity, their impact - particularly on the environment and their quality
in terms of completeness, clarity, soundness and coherence.
The TEN-T EA is also planning to host an "Info Day" on 22 April 2009 in
Brussels which will provide more information about the Calls and the evaluation
process.
