Strasbourg, 25 March 2009Spring Day for Europe 2009: school students
invited to take part in dialogue on future of EuropeThe launch of this year's 'Spring Day for Europe'
campaign to encourage school students to take part in activities to raise
awareness of European issues took place on 25 March in Strasbourg. Commission
Vice-President Margot Wallström and Katerina Batzeli, Chairwoman of the
European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, met a group of
students visiting the European Parliament to mark the occasion. The event took
place on the eve of June elections for the European Parliament.
Spring Day for Europe is an annual event organised by a network of 31
Ministries of Education in Europe, European Schoolnet, funded by the European
Commission. This year's motto is: 'Ideas Move Europe', and the event is linked
to the Year of Creativity and Innovation. Activities are being organised until
30 June in schools throughout Member States and in other European countries,
including Norway, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Switzerland. 
Activities include discussions with guest speakers on Europe, on-line chats
with Commissioners and other European public figures, debates, competitions and
other projects to stimulate awareness of European issues. Young people are
invited to network in a dialogue on the future of democracy in Europe.
"This is a great opportunity to raise young people's awareness of the
importance of the EU and its Parliament – as future voters, they need to
make their voices heard now about issues important to them" said Margot
Wallström.
"Communicating Europe to its citizens and even more to Europe's youngest
generations, to students, is not only an EU priority but the most basic element
of the agenda for the future of Europe" said Katerina Batzeli. "Spring
Day for Europe" is a way to inform, to involve, to activate the school society
in a way that they may exercise their right to participate in the democratic
life of the Union." 
“We look forward to innovation and creativity in abundance from
young people as they shape the future of Europe' said Ján Figel’,
Commissioner in charge of education and training. He has already taken part in
an on-line chat with schools. 'Each year, tens of thousands of young
Europeans take part in European programmes specially designed for them.
Access to good information on Europe and opportunities to discuss our
future are essential training in citizenship.'
Previous Spring Day for Europe campaign themes have included intercultural
dialogue, debating our future, and enlargement of the European Union.
Over 4,000 schools have registered so far to take part in events, supported
