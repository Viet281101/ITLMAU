Brussels, 11th February 2009112: Commission says EU single emergency
number must get multilingualSince December 2008, EU citizens can contact
emergency services from anywhere in the European Union by dialing 112, the
EU-wide emergency number, free of charge from both fixed and mobile phones. But,
only one in four Europeans knows that this life-saving number exists in other
Member States and almost three in ten 112 callers in other countries have
encountered language problems. Today the Commission, along with the European
Parliament and the Council, declared February 11 "European 112 Day" to spread
the word about 112 and push national authorities to make the EU's single
emergency number more multilingual.
"The European emergency number should no longer be Europe’s best
kept secret. We have a single emergency number, 112, that works for every
emergency and every Member State and every citizen that needs it. But it is
unacceptable that less than a quarter of citizens are aware of 112, or that
language barriers prevent travellers calling 112  from communicating with the
emergency operator," said EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding. "The
EU must work to guarantee the safety of our 500 million citizens with the same
intensity as we have worked to guarantee their ability to travel freely across
the borders of 27 countries. Europe's first 112 day should act as a wake up call
to national authorities who need to improve the number of languages available in
their 112 emergency centres and boost awareness about this life-saving
number."
An EU-wide survey conducted for the European Commission shows that 94% of EU
citizens think it is useful to have a single emergency number available in the
EU. The Eurobarometer survey published today also highlighted areas where there
is still room for improvement:
Language problems: 28% of callers have language problems when they
call 112 while abroad, despite the fact that information provided by 21 Member
States indicates that their 112 emergency centres should be able to handle 112
calls in English (12 Member States in German and 11 Member States in
French).
Awareness of 112: Overall, only 24% of surveyed Europeans could
spontaneously identify 112 as the number on which they can call emergency
services anywhere in the EU. This is a 2% improvement since February 2008 but
knowledge of the EU's emergency number varies greatly between countries, from 3%
in Italy to 58% in the Czech Republic. Many Member States are informing their
citizens and visitors about 112, for example:In Finland 112 day is celebrated annually on 11 February. 
Visitors to Bulgaria receive a welcome text message informing them
about 112.
112 is publicised on motorways and toll gates in Austria, Greece and
Spain and at train stations and airports in Belgium, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Ireland, Greece and the Netherlands, among others. 
Media campaigns are organised in Sweden before the travel season
informing citizens about 112. At least a 10% increase in awareness
of 112 was seen in Bulgaria, Sweden, Romania, Lithuania, and Portugal in
the past year. 
The Eurobarometer survey also showed that:A quarter of EU citizens have called an emergency number in the last five
years.  
The majority of calls still made from fixed lines: while 53% of calls were
made from a fixed line, there was an increase in emergency calls made from
mobile phones (45% compared to 42% in 2008).To ensure that 112 is
known all over Europe, the European Commission, together with the European
Parliament and Council, have declared 11 February 'European 112 Day'. The
Commission and Member States will step up their efforts to publicise 112,
especially before the summer holiday period.
Background
The European emergency number 112 was introduced in 1991 to provide, in
addition to national emergency numbers, a single emergency call number in all EU
Member States to make emergency services more accessible, especially for
travellers. Since 1998, EU rules have required Member States to ensure that all
fixed and mobile phone users can call 112 free of charge. Since 2003, telecoms
operators must provide caller location information to emergency services so that
they can find accident victims quickly. EU Member States must also raise
citizens' awareness of 112.
To ensure 112 is put in place, the Commission has launched 17 infringement
proceedings against 15 countries due to a lack of availability of 112,
caller location or appropriate call handling. Most of these have been closed
following corrective measures.
While 112 complements existing national emergency numbers, Denmark, Finland,
the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and most recently Romania have decided to make
112 their main national emergency number. In other countries, 112 is the only
emergency number for certain emergency services (such as Estonia and Luxembourg
for ambulances or fire brigades).

Calls in foreign languages
Among the 23 Member States, which provided information on the language issue,
19 Member States (in addition to the United Kingdom and Ireland) reported on the
ability of their emergency call centres to handle calls in English (Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Cyprus,
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Romania, Slovenia,
Slovakia, Finland and Sweden). Of these Member States, Germany, Spain, France
and Slovakia indicated that English may not be available in all cases in all
emergency call centres and its availability depends on the linguistic resources
of the emergency call centres while Bulgaria and Latvia said that calls in
English can be forwarded for processing to another (central) call centre where
competent staff is available.
112 calls in French are answered in nine Member States (in addition to
France and Luxembourg) - Bulgaria (by call transfer to another call centre if
necessary), the Czech Republic (by transfer to another call centre if
necessary), Ireland, Greece, Spain (may not be available in all call centres)
the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia (subject to availability of appropriate
staff) and Finland (by involving interpretation service).
112 calls in German are also answered in nine Member States (in
addition to Germany, Austria and Luxembourg) - Bulgaria (by call transfer to
another emergency call centre if necessary), the Czech Republic, Denmark (by
call transfer to another call centre if necessary), Spain (may not be available
in all call centres), Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania (by call transfer to
another emergency call centre if necessary), Slovakia (subject to availability
of appropriate staff) and Finland (by involving an interpretation service). 
112 calls in Italian are answered in three Member States (in addition
to Italy) – Spain (may not be available in all emergency call centres),
Ireland and Romania (by call transfer to another emergency call centre if
necessary).
A number of Member States have indicated the ability of their emergency
call centres to answer calls in the languages of their neighbouring EU
countries. Thus, calls in Polish can be handled by call centres in the Czech
Republic (by call transfer to another call centre if necessary), Lithuania and
Slovakia (in call centres of certain areas); calls in Hungarian – in
Romania (by call transfer to another call centre if necessary), Slovenia (in
call centres of certain areas) and Slovakia (in call centres  of certain areas);
calls in Czech  - in Slovakia, calls in Italian – in Slovenia (in call
centres  of certain areas), calls in Portuguese – in Spain (may not be
available in all call centres) and calls in Finnish - in Estonia. Languages of
the neighbouring EU countries are also catered for by German call centres in
border areas.
Furthermore, Spanish emergency call centres can handle calls also in Swedish
(may not be available in all call centres), Irish call centres can handle 112
calls also in Polish and Romanian call centres can handle calls also in Spanish
(by call transfer to another call centre if necessary).
Finally, the United Kingdom indicated that its emergency call centres can use
an interpretation services covering 170 languages, Swedish call centres can also
use an interpretation service covering all major EU languages and French call
centres can use interpretation services in English and other languages.
