IP/09/1878 Brussels, 4 December 2009 EU Healthy Eating Campaign "The Tasty Bunch": The road shows draw to an end, but the campaign marches on The EU Healthy Eating Campaign, "The Tasty Bunch", visited 173 schools across Europe as road show busses brought quizzes and games into the playground to tell kids about the need to make wise food choices. Approximately 17 000 kids took part in the road shows which ran until the end of November, learning about the benefits of fruit, vegetables and dairy products. Thousands more are learning from "The Tasty Bunch" interactive website, now the focal point of the "Eat it, Drink it, Move it" campaign. Launched by Commissioner Marianne Fischer Boel on 28 September (see  IP/09/1366 ), the road shows visited Belgium, France, the UK, Ireland, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland. Activities were aimed at the 8-12 age groups and included an initial presentation on the need to eat healthily, followed by team games and an introduction to the Tasty Bunch web site. Feed back has been very positive with schools calling the event interesting, instructive and interactive. Although road show fun and games are over this year, the website is still going strong. Tasty Bunch characters, in the form of animated rebellious fruit, vegetables and dairy products, tell their stories to get the same message across to a young audience â€“ eat well now, be well later while the Treasure Hunt is offering prizes to lucky participants.
