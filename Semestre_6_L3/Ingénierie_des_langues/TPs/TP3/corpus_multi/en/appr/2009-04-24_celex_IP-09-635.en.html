Brussels, 24 April 2009European platform launched to better
coordinate efforts to tackle Roma exclusionA new European platform for Roma inclusion will
meet for the first time today in Prague to improve coordination of national
actions to tackle the exclusion of Europe's biggest ethnic minority. The meeting
brings together national governments, the EU, other international organisations
and civil society and aims to stimulate cooperation and exchange of experience
on successful Roma inclusion policies.
"The current economic crisis increases the risk that the Roma – who are
often living at the margins of society – will be totally excluded," warned
Vladimír Špidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social affairs
and Equal Opportunities. "We need constructive policies which give the Roma a
chance, not repressive ones which drive them further into poverty and social
exclusion. Policies should explicitly target the Roma – but with the aim
of giving them access to mainstream education, mainstream jobs and mainstream
housing. And effective policies should be shared across national boundaries."Today's meeting, co-organised by Commissioner Špidla and the Czech
Minister for Human Rights and National Minorities, Michael Kocáb, will
review progress in tackling Roma exclusion since the first European Roma Summit,
held in Brussels in September 2008 (see IP/08/1326).
It follows a call from the General Affairs Council in December 2008 to organise
an exchange of good practice and experience between EU countries and to
stimulate cooperation between all parties by means of an integrated European
platform.
The meeting aims to identify a set of basic principles needed to effectively
address the inclusion of Roma. In addition, the European Commission will outline
how it plans to target the needs of Roma people with EU-level instruments and
policies in 2009 and 2010. It will report too on the implementation of a new EUR
5 million pilot project which the European Parliament has added to the 2009
Budget. The Commission will present a fuller progress report early in 2010 in
time for the next Roma Summit to be held in Spain in April 2010.
The situation of several millions of Roma in the EU and its neighbours is
characterised by discrimination and far-reaching exclusion from mainstream
society, with disproportional rates of poverty and unemployment, poor health
status and lower life expectancy. In addition, Roma are often victims of
discrimination and racist violence.
Background
The European Union has a broad range of instruments at its disposal to tackle
the discrimination and social exclusion of Roma. Directive 2000/43/EC prohibits
discrimination on grounds of race and ethnic origin in employment, education,
social protection (including health care) and access to goods and services. The
EU Structural Funds and Community programmes can provide financial support for
projects and policies while policy cooperation mechanisms at EU and national
level in the areas of social inclusion, employment, education and health can be
used to tackle Roma exclusion through a combination of targeted analysis and
action and of mainstreaming.
