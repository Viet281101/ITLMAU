Brussels, 19 January 2009Interim forecasts for 2009-2010:  slowdown
sharpens but growth will come back before the end of 2009GDP growth in the European Union is expected to
fall by 1.8 % in 2009 before recovering moderately to 0.5% in 2010. This is the
result of the impact on the real economy of the intensified financial crisis,
the ensuing global downturn manifested in the severe contraction of world trade
and manufacturing output and, in some countries, housing-market corrections.
Government consumption and public investment, however, will provide relief. The
fact that inflationary pressures have eased also contributes to private
consumption. The discretionary fiscal measures announced since August 2008 will
limit the contraction in GDP growth by about ¾ pp. this year. The severity
of the economic downturn will have a significant impact on employment and public
finances over the forecast horizon.  
"The measures to stabilise the financial market, the easing of monetary
policies and the economic recovery plans will enable us to put a floor under the
deterioration of the economy this year and create the conditions for a gradual
recovery in the second part of 2009. The top priority is to make those measures
work effectively: to improve the flows of credit at reasonable prices and to
implement the fiscal stimulus packages quickly to stimulate investment and
private consumption.  To boost confidence, it is also crucial that Member States
explicitly commit  that they will reverse the deterioration of public finances
as soon as we return to normal economic times so as to ensure the medium-to-long
term sustainability of public finances", said Joaquín Almunia, Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner.
Economic growth is forecast to have dropped to about 1% in 2008 in both the
EU and the euro area, from just below 3% in 2007, according to the advanced
interim forecast released
today[1]. In 2009, real GDP is
expected to fall sharply, by 1.8% in the EU and 1.9 in the euro area, before
recovering by about ½% in 2010.  
Global economy in recession this year
Economic activity worldwide is expected to have fallen markedly in the last
quarter of 2008. Declines in recent survey data and incoming orders, among
others, indicate that this weakness is likely to persist in the short term. The
economic downturn is expected to be broad-based with negative spillovers
increasingly affecting emerging-market economies. For 2009 as a whole, world GDP
growth is projected to slow down to 0.5% (from 3.3% in 2008 and the
exceptionally strong 5% average in 2004-2007). Starting in the second half of
2009, global growth is expected to rise gradually but moderately as the
financial market situation improves and the impact of the macroeconomic policy
easing (not least in the US) gains traction. Overall, global GDP growth is
expected to be around 2¾% in 2010. 
EU economy also hit hard
In the third quarter of 2008 GDP fell by 0.2% in both the euro area and the
EU. This implies that the euro area entered its first technical recession as GDP
contracted for the second consecutive quarter. Following the further slump in
survey data across sectors and countries and the marked deterioration in other
leading indicators during the fourth quarter, the outlook is for a continued
fall in GDP throughout the first half of this year. The downswing is expected to
be broad-based across countries as the financial crisis, the global cycle and,
in some Member States, also a housing bust take their toll. The fall in both
private and net foreign demand is expected to be a significant drag on GDP
growth, with only government consumption and public investment providing
relief.
In particular private investment, which was a key driving force in the
upturn, faces an abrupt slowdown on the back of a substantial drop in capacity
utilisation rates, the deterioration in the economic outlook and tighter
financing conditions.
Unemployment and deficits on the rise
The labour market situation started to worsen in most Member States in 2008.
Reacting with a certain lag to changes in GDP growth, employment growth is
expected to turn negative this year, with EU employment falling by 3½
million jobs. As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to increase to
8¾% in the EU in 2009 (and 9¼% in the euro area), with a further
increase in 2010.
The worsened outlook is also expected to take a toll on public finances,
which will suffer from the reversal of past revenue windfalls, a generally less
tax-rich composition of growth and the impact of important discretionary
measures adopted and/or announced by Member States (which amount to some 1% of
GDP for 2009 in the EU at the time this forecast was finalised). The headline
deficit is therefore expected to more than double this year in the EU to
4½% in 2009 (from some 1¾% to 4% in the euro area). 
Inflation set to fall rapidly
Inflationary pressures are abating rapidly. The fierce upsurge in commodity
prices that drove inflation to a peak in the summer of 2008 has since been
abruptly reversed, amid a rapid weakening in growth prospects for the EU and the
global economy as well as deteriorating labour markets. These elements set the
stage for a significant downward revision to the inflation outlook compared to
the autumn projection. Consumer-price inflation is now expected to fall from
3.7% in 2008 in the EU (3.3% in the euro area) to 1.2% in 2009 (1.0% in the euro
area) and just below 2% in 2010 in both regions.
Substantial uncertainties at the current juncture
This forecast is again surrounded by exceptional uncertainty as the world
economy faces its worst crisis since World War II. Risks to the growth outlook
are balanced. To the downside, we need to consider the impact of the financial
crisis (including on the housing sector) and the severity of the negative
feedback loop between the financial and real sectors of the economy. On the
other hand, growth could be stronger than expected if inter alia the
fiscal packages restore confidence among investors and consumers more swiftly
than assumed. Risks to the inflation outlook also appear balanced, following
developments in commodity prices and the deterioration of economic prospects
globally.

[1] The Commission usually
publishes its interim forecast in February and only for the EU's seven biggest
economies and for inflation and growth in the current year. The present exercise
resembles more closely the spring and autumn forecasts and is justified by the
exceptionally rapid deterioration in the economic situation and outlook since
the autumn and the importance of reflecting this in the annual assessment of
Member States' Stability and Convergence Programmes.
