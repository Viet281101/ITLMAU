Brussels, 29 January 2009Consumers: EU to ban dimethylfumarate (DMF)
in consumer products, such as sofas and shoesThe use of the biocide (DMF) dimethylfumarate -
which has caused severe allergic reactions in hundreds of consumers, because of
its use in every day consumer products such as couches and shoes - looks set to
be banned across the EU. Today, Member States voted in favour of a draft
European Commission Decision to ensure that consumer products, such as leather
furniture or footwear, containing the strongly sensitising (DMF) are not placed
on the market in the EU. If already on the market, these products will have to
be recalled and withdrawn without delay. In countries such as France, Finland,
Poland, Sweden and the UK, consumers exposed to products containing DMF, have
experienced serious health problems including skin itching, irritation, redness,
burns and, in some cases, acute respiratory difficult. The draft Commission
decision is for an emergency EU wide measure, pending the adoption of a more
permanent regulatory solution. Following today's vote, the draft Commission
decision will be submitted for consultation to the European Parliament before
going before the College of Commissioners for final approval.
EU Consumer Affairs Commissioner Meglena Kuneva, said: "There can be no
compromise on safety.  I am pleased to see that that the RAPEX system has been
functioning well to ensure dangerous goods containing DMF are quickly removed
from the market.  But we need to go further with urgent EU action to tackle the
problem at source. An EU wide ban on the use of DMF in all consumer goods is
designed to eliminate the serious health risks and in particular the severe
allergic reactions suffered by some consumers when they are exposed to this
chemical simply by using everyday leather goods." 
The risk from DMF
Dimethylfumarate (DMF) is used by producers as a biocide to kill moulds that
may cause furniture or shoe leather to deteriorate during storage and
transportation in a humid climate. Placed in sachets, which are fixed inside the
furniture or added to the footwear boxes, DMF evaporates and impregnates the
leather, protecting it from moulds. However, it has been found to seriously
affect consumers who were in contact with the products. DMF penetrated through
the clothes onto the skin of many
consumers[1], where it caused
painful dermatitis. The fact that in serious cases it is particularly difficult
to treat adds to the damage. The presence of DMF is thus a serious risk.
The dangerous chemical initially raised concerns when notified by a number of
Member State authorities through the EU rapid alert system for dangerous
non-food consumer products (RAPEX).
The notifications related to sofas, armchairs and shoes, and clinical tests
confirmed that the dermatitis suffered by consumers in contact with these
produtcs was caused by DMF[2].
France and Belgium subsequently put national bans in place and Spain is also
preparing to do so. The new Decision which was agreed today will cover all
Member States.
The existing rules 
DMF is already banned for use in the manufacture of goods in the EU, since
biocidal products containing DMF are not authorised under the Biocides Directive
(98/8/EC). However, manufacturers outside the EU may use these unauthorised
biocides and then export their products to the EU. Today's Decision therefore
protects EU consumers from the risk of DMF in imported products in the same way
as they are protected at home.
Recent measures introduced by Member States 
In December 2008, France adopted a
decree[3] which bans the
importation and placing on the market of seating and footwear containing DMF for
1 year. The French decree also requires the recall of all seating and footwear
which visibly contains, or the packaging of which visibly contains, DMF. In
January 2009, Belgium issued a
decree[4], which bans the
placing on the market of all articles and products containing DMF. Spain is
considering introducing a measure. 
Background - RAPEX
RAPEX is the EU rapid alert system for dangerous non-food consumer products,
providing a rapid exchange of information between Member States and the
Commission to prevent marketing or use of products posing a serious risk to the
health and safety of consumers.
