      Europeans overwhelmingly consider the environmental impact of products they buy
      Four out of five Europeans say that they consider the environmental impact of the products they buy reveals a Eurobarometer
         survey published today. Environmental consideration was highest in Greece where more than 9 in 10 of those surveyed said the
         impact of a product on the environment plays an important aspect in their purchasing decisions. In the same survey Europeans were evenly divided about claims by producers on the environmental performance of their products
            while nearly half thought that a combination of increased taxes on environmentally-damaging products and decreased taxes on
            environmentally-friendly products would best promote eco-friendly products. There was also strong support for retailers to
            play a role in promoting environmentally-friendly products and for mandatory carbon labelling. 
      EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: "The battle against climate change must be fought on all fronts and everyone
         must contribute. It is not only the remit of companies and governments; consumers also have their part to play. By purchasing
         environmentally and climate-friendly products individual customers send the right signal to producers who respond in turn
         by producing more eco-friendly products."Impact of products on the environment important
      In the Eurobarometer survey published today on Europeans' attitude towards sustainable consumption and production, an overwhelming
            majority of Europeans (83%) said the impact of a product on the environment plays an important aspect in their purchasing
            decisions. With 92% in favour Greeks were more likely to consider the environmental impact of the products they buy while
            the Czechs were the least likely (62%).
      Mixed views on claims by companies on the environmental performance of their products
      Europeans surveyed were evenly divided about claims by producers about the environmental performance of their products with
         49% trusting the claims and 48% not trusting such claims. The Dutch were more likely to trust these claims (78%) while Bulgarians
         were the least likely (26%).Higher taxes on environmentally-damaging products and lower taxes on environmentally-friendly products 
      Some 46% of EU citizens also thought that the best way to promote environmentally-friendly products would be to increase taxes on environmentally-damaging
            products and decrease taxes on environmentally-friendly products. Britons were most in favour of such a double taxation system
            while the Maltese much less so (28%) preferring instead reducing taxes on environmentally-friendly products only.The important role of retailers in promoting environmentally-friendly products 
      Those surveyed were strongly in favour of retailers promoting environmentally-friendly products. Approximately half of EU
         citizens (49%) thought that they should increase the visibility of such products on their shelves or have a dedicated green
         corner in their store. A third (31%) of Europeans said that the best way for retailers to promote green products is for them
         to provide better information to consumers.Strong support for carbon footprint labels 
      Despite just under half of Europeans saying that ecolabels play an important role in their purchasing decisions and only 1
         in 10 saying the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions created by a product should feature on environmental labels, some
         72% of EU citizens thought that a label indicating a product's carbon footprint should be mandatory in the future. Attitudes
         on the subject varied widely between Member States with the Czechs the least in favour of such labelling (47%) and Greeks
         wholeheartedly behind the idea with 90% in favour.A carbon footprint label would show the total amount of greenhouse gases – including carbon dioxide – emitted during its lifetime,
         from production to disposal. At present no such scheme exists Europe-wide, but at the December 2008 Environment Council ministers
         invited the Commission to study the introduction of carbon footprint labelling.Background: EU Action Plan on sustainable consumption and production
      In July 2008 the Commission presented an action plan which includes a series of proposals on sustainable consumption and production
            that will contribute to improve the environmental performance of products and increase the demand for more sustainable goods
            and production technologies. It also seeks to encourage EU industry to take advantage of opportunities to innovate.
