Brussels, 22 April 2009The Bologna Process – reforming
universities in the next decadeOn 28 and 29 April,
Ministers responsible for higher education from 46 European countries will meet
in Leuven and Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, to take stock of the achievements of
the Bologna Process, set a new agenda, and agree priorities for the European
Higher Education Area for the next decade up to 2020. Reflecting the huge
interest from countries outside Europe in the reforms taking place in the
European Higher Education Area, for the first time a 'Bologna Policy Forum' will
take place between the 46 countries participating in the Process and 20
countries from outside
Europe.[1]
The Bologna process has grown from 29 countries in 1999 to 46
today[2]  – it is a
European success story. The latest Bologna Stocktaking Report, which is
to be presented to Ministers in Leuven and Louvain-la-Neuve concludes that good,
albeit somewhat uneven, progress has been made in implementing the Bologna
reforms. The Commission's latest report in support of the process confirms this
positive conclusion and indicates that substantial progress has been made,
including on structural reforms. The focus should now be on modernising national
policies and on achieving concrete implementation of the reforms of Europe's
higher education institutions.
The main Bologna reforms concentrate on:the three-cycle degree structure (bachelor, master, doctorate), 
quality assurance in higher education, and 
recognition of qualifications and periods of study.
Together, these reform efforts have created new opportunities for
universities and students. The launch last year of the European Quality
Assurance Register for Higher Education is helping to raise the visibility of
European higher education and boost confidence in institutions and programmes
within Europe and worldwide.
Commenting on the forthcoming meeting, the European Commissioner for
Education, Training, Culture and Youth, Ján Figel’, said: "The
Bologna Process has led to greater compatibility and comparability of systems of
higher education. Among other things, it has made Europe a more attractive
destination for students from other continents. While there is still some work
to meet the objectives that were set out in 1999, we need to continuously move
forward to address new challenges, particularly in the current economic crisis.
Higher education has a key role to play in supporting sustainable economic
recovery and in stimulating innovation. The universities must modernise, and the
widespread recognition of this need by governments not only in Europe, but also
around the world, gives the Bologna Process the vital support it needs for
success."
A recent Eurobarometer Survey among students in higher education shows
that students want wider access to higher education and that universities should
open up cooperation with the world of work and to lifelong learning. For
example, an overwhelming 97% of students believed that it was important to
provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to be successful in the
labour market. 
A large majority (87%) also agreed that it was important for higher education
institutions to foster innovation and an entrepreneurial mindset among
students and staff, and that there should be a possibility to undertake
work placements in private enterprises as part of a study programme. More
students want to study abroad and a majority want more information about the
quality of higher education institutions in order to make informed study
choices. 
The European Commission is working with Member States and the higher
education sector to help implement the modernisation agenda for universities in
the framework of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. Support is
provided through the Lifelong Learning Programme (Erasmus actions), the
7th EU Framework Programme for Research and the Competitiveness and
Innovation Programme, as well as the Structural Funds and loans from the
European Investment Bank (EIB). 
The Commission also supports higher education reforms in the wider world, in
concrete terms, through its external policies and programmes; support for the
EU's neighbouring countries is available, for example, through the Tempus
programme. Relations with other partner countries are supported through a series
of bilateral or multilateral cooperation programmes: EU-USA/Canada, EDULINK,
ALFA for Latin America and the new Nyerere Programme for Africa. Finally, there
is also the Erasmus Mundus programme, which provides scholarships for
students from across the world to study on integrated master-level programmes in
different European countries. The new phase of the programme also includes
doctoral studies. Cooperation with non-European institutions is also provided
for in the Commission's support to research activities of higher education
institutions through the 7th EU Framework Programme for Research. The Marie
Curie Actions offer opportunities to individual researchers to participate in a
research team in another country.
