Brussels, 21 January 2009European Group on Ethics (EGE) asks European
Commission to embed ethical principles in agriculture
policiesThe European Group on Ethics (EGE) today met with
Mariann Fischer Boel, the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture and Rural
Development to present the main recommendations of the Group's opinion on the
ethical implications of modern developments in agriculture
technologies.
Following a request from President Barroso, the EGE adopted in December an
opinion on the ethical implications of modern developments in agriculture
technologies, in order to address the new challenges and opportunities which lie
ahead for EU agriculture. The group decided to focus primarily on agriculture
technologies and methods for primary production of food of plant origin.
In this opinion the EGE shows its awareness for the need for promoting
innovation in agriculture in order to be able to feed the growing world
population. It adds that technologies alone cannot provide final solutions to
the challenges modern agriculture is facing in the EU and worldwide.
The Group emphasises the need for an integrated view and an integrated
approach on agriculture technologies so that the production, storage and
distribution processes are considered together when the implications of any new
technology is assessed ethically. The goals of (1) food security, (2) food
safety and (3) sustainability are considered to be the first priorities and
guiding principles to which any technology in agriculture must adhere.
Using this ethical framework as a point of departure, the EGE also makes
recommendations on a plethora of issues, such as: revision of EU Common
Agriculture Policy, technology impact assessment of agricultural technologies;
the right to food; Sustainability of agriculture technologies; Food safety;
Agricultural biodiversity; Soil and water protection; Biofuels; GM crops;
Research in agricultural sciences; policy-making in arable agriculture; Global
trade in agricultural products; Intellectual Property Rights system; Fair
competition and “vertical monopolies”; Food prices; Societal
aspects; Public participation; Responsibility of EU citizens; Food waste
etc.
