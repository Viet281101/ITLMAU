Brussels, 25 February 2009Commission meets employers and trades unions
to tackle the economic crisis and take action on jobsThe European Commission today continued its work to
implement the European Economic Recovery Plan with a special meeting with the
representatives of trades unions and employers at EU level. It showed a wide
consensus that the internal market and the Recovery Plan provided the right
springboard for tackling the crisis and taking action on jobs in Europe, and
that further measures would have to be put in place at EU level.
"Tackling the economic crisis and taking action on jobs means working
together" said President Barroso. The Commission's policy is aimed at limiting
the impact of the crisis on the real economy and jobs, preparing businesses and
the workforce for recovery and helping Europeans to find jobs that are
sustainable for the future. The impact of the crisis on employment is evident.
To arrest the downturn, to limit the loss of jobs and business shutdowns, and to
put Europe back on the road to growth and jobs, we need a partnership. I am
delighted to have this opportunity to discuss with the social partners how to
target our work most effectively, and how we can come together to deliver
results."
In the meeting today, the Commission and the European social partners (ETUC,
Business Europe, CEEP and UEAPME) agreed on the need to work together to
safeguard and develop further the social and economic achievements of the EU and
its internal market as the source of prosperity, growth and jobs in Europe.
The European social partners also welcomed the European Economic Recovery
Plan as the right starting point and made clear their readiness to work to
ensure its effective implementation and to carry it through into further action
with the ambition required.
The European Economic Recovery Plan proposed by the Commission and adopted by
the European Council in December sets out a wide range of measures to keep and
create jobs and maximise the ability of the European economy to get through the
recession.
Many of the key elements in the Recovery Plan will have a direct impact on
the workforce. These include training to keep people in work and to help them
find new jobs. EU funding is available through the European Social Fund and the
European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and new sources of finance are available
for SMEs.
The discussion with the social partners' representatives focused on their
proposals for measures to enhance growth and employment, to implement
flexicurity measures and support companies and workers through the recession, to
encourage investment and keep up purchasing power and demand, to respect free
movement of workers and collective agreements, and to guarantee the continuation
of the single market.  Their views will be fed into the input of the Commission
to the 1 March informal meeting of Heads of State and Government, the Spring
European Council and the Employment Summit which will take place in May.  The
Commission and the social partners agreed to work closely together and to find
ways to ensure that employers and trades unions from across the European Union
can contribute to the successful recovery of the European economy.
The representatives of the social partners who attended this meeting were:
Business Europe: Ernest-Antoine Seillière, President; CEEP: Carl
Cederschiöld, President; ETUC: John Monks, General Secretary; UEAPME: Georg
Toifl, President.
