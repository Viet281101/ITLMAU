Brussels, 24 February 2009Commission increases flexibility of
structural funds in response to financial crisisIn response to the financial and economic crisis,
Regional Policy Commissioner Danuta Hübner has announced a package of
decisions by the European Commission aimed at giving Member States more
flexibility in their use of the structural funds. The changes will extend the
deadline for EU countries to use up their allocations from the 2000-2006 funding
period and ensure that every available euro can be used to maximum effect.Commenting on the decisions to increase the deadline for projects and
payments by six months to 30 June 2009, Commissioner Hübner said: "All
our efforts are being deployed to ensure that every euro from the structural
funds is spent in an efficient way. We are adapting the Cohesion Policy to
address new economic realities and to allow Member States to optimise EU
investment as an excellent anti-crisis remedy". 
Deadline extended for four structural funds
Following an invitation by the Commission, Member states have requested an
extension to the eligibility period for funding for 385 of the 555 Cohesion
Policy programmes in 2000-2006, where funds had not been fully utilised. The
extended eligibility period concerns the four structural funds in place at the
time: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF),
the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and the Financial
Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG).
This flexibility will enable Member States and regions to implement and
finalise more projects on the ground. The Commission is urging them to focus on
'high-return' sectors and measures, such as investing in energy efficiency to
create green jobs and save energy, and support for clean technologies to boost
sectors like the construction and automotive industries.
Five times more flexibility
The Commission has also adopted a measure to give Member States and regions
more flexibility in allocating funding for different priorities. Until now,
managing authorities had a 2% margin of flexibility if they wanted to transfer
funding between the so-called 'priority axes' that define the strategic spending
areas of each Cohesion Policy operational programme. 
"The situation we find ourselves in now is very different to the economic
environment in 2000, when the priorities were agreed. In recognition of the
exceptional circumstances faced by Member States, the Commission has decided on
a five-fold increase in flexibility between priorities, from 2 to 10%. This will
enable the Member States to target remaining funding where its impact is
greatest," commented Commissioner Hübner.
Note for editors
The Commission is examining all possibilities to increase and speed up
Community investment and to facilitate financial transfers to the Member States
and, consequently, to the final beneficiaries of the structural funds. In this
context, a number of legislative proposals and non-legislative measures
concerning both the previous and existing (2007-2013) programming periods have
been adopted or are in course of adoption (see MEMO/08/740).
The total funding allocated to Member States in the 2000-2006 budgetary
period was €257 billion. So far, €225 billion have been paid out
– 87.5% of the total. Member States can now make payments for this period
up to 30 June 2009. The deadline for Cohesion Fund payments from the 2000-2006
period is in most cases the end of 2010.
