Brussels, 14 May 2009Telecoms: Italy urged to take action on 112
caller location to comply with Court judgementCaller location information is still not available
to emergency services from all mobile 112 calls in Italy, as required by EU
rules, despite a judgement from the European Court of Justice in January calling
on Italy to make this happen. The Commission has today decided to send a letter
of formal notice to Italy requesting it to comply with the judgement and to
ensure that caller location information is available to emergency services for
all 112 calls. Italy could be fined if the case proceeds to the European Court
of Justice again. 
"The provision of caller location information to emergency services is
crucial for the effective functioning of Europe’s single emergency number
112," said EU Telecoms Commissioner Viviane Reding. "Most Member States
have already introduced it and there is no reason why Italy cannot also
implement this truly vital service for its citizens. The Commission has to
pursue the infringement proceeding against Italy to ensure that the European
Court of Justice judgement is followed and because the availability of caller
location information is an emergency tool which can help save
lives.”
On 15 January 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled that Italy failed to
make 112 caller location information available to authorities handling
emergencies for all calls. Caller location information is not yet available to
emergency services throughout Italy for calls made to 112 from mobile phones,
except in the province of Salerno. 
The Commission noted steps taken by the Italian authorities to ensure
availability of caller location information for 112. Nevertheless, it calls on
the Italian Government to accelerate the implementation of caller location
information for all calls made to 112 throughout the country. If Italy does not
respond to this call for improvement within two months, it runs the risk of
being fined for not respecting the Court's judgment. 
The provision of caller location information to emergency services for 112
calls contributes to the safety of European citizens. Italian and other European
citizens, when at home or travelling as tourists or for professional reasons in
other EU countries, must be able to rely on the ability of Italian emergency
services to locate them when they make a call and cannot themselves provide
details of their location for dispatching help. 
Background
Under the EU's Universal Service Directive (Article 26), Member States have
an obligation to guarantee the proper functioning of the single European
emergency number 112. This includes making sure caller location information is
available to emergency authorities for all calls made to 112. 
In total, the Commission has launched infringement proceedings against 14
Member States regarding 112 caller location. 11 of those cases have been closed
as the Member States remedied the situation and caller location information
became fully available. Apart from Italy, the European Court of Justice has also
issued judgments ruling that Lithuania and the Netherlands have not complied
with EU law requirements regarding 112 caller location and these cases are also
pending.
In addition, the Commission has in the past also launched infringement
proceedings against two other Member States for failure to ensure availability
of 112 as the number for calling emergency services. The last case concerning
Bulgaria was closed on 29 January this year and 112 is now available throughout
the EU (IP/08/1968).
Finally, another case was launched against Italy in September 2008 regarding the
handling of calls to 112 (IP/08/1342).
The European Commission has decided, under Article 228 of the EC Treaty, to
send a letter of formal notice asking Italy for full information on its
compliance with the January judgment of the European Court of Justice. If the
Italian authorities still do not comply, the Commission will send a reasoned
opinion to the Italian government and, ultimately, can ask the Court to impose a
penalty payment.
