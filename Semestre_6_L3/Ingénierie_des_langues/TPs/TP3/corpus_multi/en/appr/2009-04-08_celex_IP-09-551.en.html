Brussels, 8 April 2009Commission sets harder targets for faster
payments of EU grants and contractsAn initiative introducing new and tougher targets
for the payment of EU funds managed directly by the European Commission was
adopted today. The proposals aim to step up ongoing efforts and speed up cash
flow to beneficiaries – often small businesses and local managing
authorities. They will apply to €15 billion of funds that have specific
payment times covering areas like research, education and youth, energy and
transport. One of the key targets is to cut the times for initial pre-financing
of EU grants and contracts from 30 to 20 days. The proposals complement recent
decisions to speed up payments for Structural Funds projects as announced in the
European Economic Recovery Plan (IP/08/1983),
as well as proposals to combat late payments in commercial transactions (IP/09/552).
Dalia Grybauskaitė, EU Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget
said "the aim of today's proposal is to squeeze as much as possible out of
the current financial rules to speed up the  415,000 or so direct payments the
Commission makes each year”. She underlined the timely nature of the
proposal adding "the current economic climate requires immediate measures to
help ease the situation for cash beneficiaries. This initiative will also pave
the way for future changes to EU financial rules planned in 2010". 
The main focus of the communication is to reduce the time limits for
pre-financing, or initial payments from 30 to 20 days. These payments are the
most straightforward as they do not require any complex paperwork or bureaucracy
and represent around €9.5bn. For other centrally managed payments
(representing roughly €5.5bn), the target is to cut payment times from 45
to 30 days, bringing European Commission payments into line with the directive
on combating late payments in commercial transactions. The Commission will also
encourage its services to increase the use of flat rates and lump sums for
centrally managed grants and contracts. 
Simplifying general procedures before projects get off the ground can
contribute to faster payments so measures offering the Commission services the
possibility to publish calls for proposals covering two years rather than
individual ones and to use standardised calls will be introduced. Sharing
knowledge and experience is an important aspect in accelerating payments and the
Commission’s budget Directorate-General (DG BUDG) will play a more active
role in assisting other services meet the various conditions required to commit
their own budgets quickly. The introduction of accelerated procedures for
procurement and grants will be encouraged wherever possible.
The Commission services will be required to report formally in their annual
activity reports on the achievement of these targets.
