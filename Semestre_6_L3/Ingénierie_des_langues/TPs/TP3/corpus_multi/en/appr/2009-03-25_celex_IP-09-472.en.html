Brussels, 25 March 2009The EU Commission cracks down on modern
slavery and child sexual abuseThe European Commission has today adopted two
proposals for new rules to step up the fight against trafficking in human beings
and child sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and child pornography. These new
proposals replace existing legislation which has been in place since
respectively 2002 and 2004. The new proposals will guarantee full alignment with
the highest European standards, provide better assistance for victims and
tougher action against criminals responsible for child sexual abuse and
trafficking. The proposals also deal with the rapidly changing technologies in
the cyberspace.
Vice President Barrot, in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security said : "We
want to build an EU that is truly able to protect the most vulnerable citizens
against the most terrible crimes. When we say trafficking in human beings we are
talking about women and girls reduced to sexual slavery, children beaten and
mistreated, forced to beg and to steal, young adults compelled to work in
appalling conditions for hunger wages. When we speak about child sexual abuse
and sexual exploitation, we are speaking about horrendous crimes against
children that leave deep scars and suffering for their whole lives."
Key facts and figures
According to International Labour Organisation globally 1.225 million people
are trafficked transnationally or within their own countries. Most victims of
trafficking are exploited for prostitution (43%) or for labour (32%). Regarding
forced commercial sexual exploitation, an overwhelming majority (98%) are women
and girls. It is reasonable to estimate from the available figures that several
hundred thousand people are trafficked into the EU or within the EU every year.Studies suggest that a significant minority of children in Europe, between
10% and 20% as an informed scientific estimate, will be sexually
assaulted during their childhood.
In 2008 more than 1000 commercial and about 500 non-commercial child abuse
content websites were found, of which 71% in the US. It is estimated that about
20% of child porn websites are non-commercial (mostly Peer-to-Peer
(P2P)). 
It is estimated that some 20% of sex offenders on average (with big
differences between different profiles of offenders) go on to commit new
offences after conviction.
The new proposals
The two proposals for Council Framework Decisions would oblige EU countries
to act on the three fronts of prosecuting criminals, protecting victims and
preventing the offences.
The proposal to fight trafficking in human beings approximates
national legislations and penalties, makes sure that offenders are brought to
justice even if they commit crimes abroad. It will allow police to use phone
tapping, eavesdropping and other similar tools used to fight organised crime.
Victims will receive accommodation and medical care and if necessary police
protection so that they recover from their plight and are not afraid to testify
against their perpetrators. They will be protected from further traumatisation
during criminal proceedings, deriving for example from probing questions about
the experience related to their forced sexual exploitation. Victims will receive
free legal aid throughout the proceedings including for the purpose of claiming
financial compensation. The proposal encourages sanctions against clients of
people forced to offer sexual services and against employers exploiting
trafficked people. The proposal also establishes independent bodies to monitor
implementation of these actions.
The proposal to fight the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of
children makes it easier to punish those who abuse children by providing
criminal sanctions for new forms of abuse like 'grooming' - luring children
through internet and abusing them, viewing child pornography without downloading
files or making children pose sexually in front of webcams. "Sex tourists"
travelling abroad to abuse children will face prosecution when they come home.
Child victims will be able to testify without having to face the offender at
court to spare them from additional trauma and will be helped by a free lawyer.
Every offender should be assessed individually and have access to tailor made
treatment so that they don't abuse again. The prohibitions from activities
involving contact with children imposed on offenders should be effective not
just in the country where they were convicted but across the EU. Systems to
block access to websites containing child pornography will be developed
The proposals will be discussed in the EU Council of Ministers and once
approved should be translated into national legislations.
VP Barrot concluded: "Our message is clear. These crimes which know no
borders are unacceptable. Europe will continue to set the highest and most
ambitious standards in fighting them".
