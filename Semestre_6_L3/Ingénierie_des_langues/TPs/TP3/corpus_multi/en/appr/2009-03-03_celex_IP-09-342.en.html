Brussels, 3rd March 2009The EU Commission will finance the European
Financial Coalition (EFC) to fight child abuse images distribution on the
Internet"The European Commission will provide up to
427.000€ of funding for the activities of a European Financial Coalition
against child sexual abuse content on the Internet," announced today Jacques
Barrot, Vice-president of the European Commission in charge of Justice, Liberty
and Security. 
The coalition - led by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP)
Centre  (the UK’s dedicated policing organisation for protecting children
from sexual exploitation) and funded by the European Commission, -  is a
public-private informal group including the police authorities, financial
operators, internet service providers, NGOs and other partners, whose aim is to
work together in the fight against child pornography. 
MasterCard, Microsoft, PayPal, VISA Europe and the NGO Missing Children
Europe are amongst the founding members of the new coalition and are joined by
Allen and Overy and ICMEC - the International Centre for Missing and Exploited
Children as advisory members to the EFC. On the law enforcement side of the EFC,
founding members also include Europol and the Italian National Postal and
Communication Police.
The Coalition was launched today at a press conference organised at the
Headquarters of the UK law enforcement agency CEOP (Child exploitation and
online protection centre), in the presence of Vice-President Jacques Barrot.
The Commission will provide up to 427.000€ of funding for the
activities of the coalition, which aims to bring together all partners engaged
in the fight against the commercial distribution of child sexual abuse images on
the Internet. The Coalition will help to identify and protect victims, locate
and arrest criminals – paedophiles as well as those who gain economically
from selling images – and, above all, to confiscate the profits from these
criminal activities. As a result, buying child pornography by credit card or
other electronic payment systems will be prevented. In addition, the Commission
will shortly put forward proposals to update and strengthen the Council
Framework Decision on combating sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of
children.
Vice-President, Jacques Barrot, Commissioner responsible for Justice, Freedom
and Security, highlighted the importance of this initiative by saying "I am
fully committed to providing the highest possible form of protection for
children against all forms of crime and abuse. It is a reality that the rapid
growth of the internet has opened up a serious criminal market for images of
child sex abuse. The European Financial Coalition will help identify and protect
victims, and, above all, confiscate the profits from these criminal activities.
However, in order for the Coalition to be fully effective, more partners,
including the Member States, need to join it. I am ready to fully support them
in their efforts. "
