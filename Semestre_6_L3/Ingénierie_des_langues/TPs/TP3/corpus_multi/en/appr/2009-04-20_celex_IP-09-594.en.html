Brussels, 20 April 2009Consumers: Annual RAPEX Report 2008 shows
rise in number of dangerous products being detectedThe number of dangerous
consumer products withdrawn from the EU market rose by 16% in 2008 compared to
in 2007, the Commission's annual report on the Community rapid alert system for
non-food dangerous products ("RAPEX") reveals today. This rise from 1 605
notifications in 2007 to 1 866 last year shows that the capacity of the RAPEX
system has substantially increased again in 2008, following a substantial
investment of resources and training by the European Commission and Member
States. European businesses in the consumer product safety area are also taking
their responsibilities more seriously and recall their unsafe products from the
market more readily. Toys with childcare articles (such as bicycles, baby
walkers, cots and soothers), electrical products and motor vehicles were the
most frequently notified products in 2008. The number of notifications on
products of Chinese origin sent through RAPEX increased (from 52% in 2007 to 59%
in 2008). This must be seen as a consequence of the focus of market surveillance
authorities on product categories known to be of higher risk.
Consumer Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said: "This report sends a very clear
message that there is no room for complacency when it comes to safety. The
biggest challenge for 2009 is to make sure that product safety is not set aside
during this period of economic crisis, that business continues to respect their
duties toward consumers and that Member States allocate sufficient resources to
enforcement. Safety is not a luxury. This report sets out clearly the
significant challenges we face and sends a clear signal that there is no place
for cost cutting or cutting corners when it comes to safety. On the contrary, in
times of economic crisis when price becomes a very prominent factor in consumer
spending, we need to step up our efforts and keep our vigilance especially
high."
Number of notified dangerous products still growing
The total number of notifications distributed through the RAPEX system has
risen gradually since 2004 (when the General Product Safety Directive, was
transposed into the national laws by Member States). In this fifth year, the
number of notifications has quadrupled from 468 (in 2004) to 1866 (in
2008). In 2008, the number of notifications rose by 16% compared to 2007.
The growth in RAPEX notifications, and the increased capacity of the system, is
a result of more effective product safety enforcement by national authorities,
greater investment of resources greater awareness amongst businesses of their
obligations, enhanced cooperation with third countries, and network-building
actions and training across MS coordinated by the European Commission.
All countries contribute to RAPEX
All EU countries participated in the RAPEX system by detecting and notifying
new dangerous products and ensuring appropriate follow-up actions to the
information received. Twelve countries further increased their activities in the
system and notified more dangerous products than in 2007. The countries making
most notifications were Germany (205 notifications), Spain (163 notifications),
Slovakia (140 notifications), Greece (132 notifications) and Hungary (129
notifications). Notifications sent by these countries represent 50% of all
notifications on products posing a serious risk sent via the system.
Toys, electrical appliances and motor vehicles top the list
Toys (498 notifications), electrical appliances (169 notifications) and motor
vehicles (160 notifications) alone accounted for 53% of all notifications on
products posing a serious risk in 2008. These results are in line with the RAPEX
results from 2007. Textile products including clothing (with 140 notifications)
became in 2008 the fourth most frequently notified - via RAPEX - category of
product.
Increase in the number of notifications on products of the Chinese originIn total, 909 notifications on products posing a serious risk sent through
the RAPEX system in 2008 concerned products manufactured in China. The number of
products of Chinese origin notified via RAPEX increased in 2008 to 59% from 52%
in 2007. The growing tendency should be seen in the context of a number of
factors, such as: increasing imports of goods to the EU from China, focus of
enforcement actions taken at the national level on products of Chinese origin,
more effective cooperation between the EU and China.
The report shows that Chinese authorities increasingly adopt restrictive
measures on their market, on the basis of the RAPEX information provided through
the "RAPEX-CHINA" application (established in September 2006). Corrective
measures taken by the Chinese authorities are communicated to the Commission on
the basis of a system of quarterly reporting introduced in 2007. Since the
establishment of the application, AQSIQ has investigated 669 RAPEX
notifications. In 352 cases (53%) investigations resulted in preventive or
restrictive measures (e.g. export ban/stop, strengthen supervision over the
Chinese manufacturer/exporter) being adopted either by AQSIQ or voluntarily by
the Chinese manufacturer/exporter.
