Brussels, 18 May 2009Your vote matters. Please use
it.Between 4 and 7 June, 375 million citizens across
27 countries, from Helsinki to Lisbon, from Dublin to Vilnius, are called to the
polls to elect the European Parliament. In a video message posted on his
website, the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso,
urges people to turn out and vote.
“Your vote matters. Because your choice will help shape the European
Union's course of action for the next five years,” says Mr Barroso in
the video message which can be found on his website:

The video is available in six languages (English, French, German, Spanish,
Portuguese and Italian) on Mr Barroso’s website and on the European
Commission’s audiovisual portal. The written version of the message is
also available in the other 17 EU languages.
The Commission President says that although the Commission will continue to
take the political initiative and make the necessary proposals to deliver
concrete results for citizens, “it is the European Parliament that
makes the laws, together with your national governments.” He goes on
to say that it is the European Parliament that holds the other European
Institutions to account.
“You must choose the members of parliament that reflect your
views on how to tackle the challenges we face, because what Europe does will
affect you and your daily life.”
