Brussels, 14 May 2009Consumers: Airlines move to clean up ticket
selling websitesNew EU results published today show a "step change"
in airline ticket selling websites across Europe in terms of compliance with
consumer protection rules. The findings feature in a final report on an 18 month
EU-wide process to crackdown on misleading advertising and unfair practices. As
a result of an EU enforcement investigation started in September 2007 –
with 15 EU national authorities and Norway - 115 airline websites out of the 137
websites investigated have been corrected. Following an additional "health
check" process involving independent mystery shopping in March 2009 on 67 major
airlines, 52 airlines have either been given a "clean bill of health" and
undertaken to maintain the same standards or immediately responded to the
Commission's consultation with undertakings to remedy outstanding issues (see
lists below). The health check process checked websites against a comprehensive
14 point checklist, which was previously agreed with the airline industry. The
Commission is now working to put in place an industry wide agreement to provide
a level playing field for airlines across the EU and to maintain sites to a high
standard. 
"EU Consumer Commissioner, Meglena Kuneva said: This Europe-wide airline
investigation is changing the face of airline websites across the EU. There is
no room for complacency; there is more work to be done. But this first pan
European enforcement investigation has shown it has real "teeth "and can
deliver. The next step is an industry wide agreement, and we will continue to
monitor developments in the sector closely."
Vice President Antonio Tajani, in charge of Transport said, "Applying full
price transparency is an obligation under the air services regulation. It is a
duty for airlines to impose high standards across the industry; it is our
responsibility to ensure that all players respect the same rules. This is of
first and foremost importance for the consumer who wants to compare prices
across airlines and make a real choice."
1.	Results of the 2007 Airline Ticket Selling Sweep Investigation 
Enforcement actions have now been completed in 85% of cases. Of the
137 websites investigated representing about 80 companies, 115 have now been
corrected (see summary table in attached MEMO/09/238
showing the enforcement data as of end March 2009.)
2.	The airlines health-check study 
The Health Check process, aimed to comprehensively monitor the overall
situation in the area of online air ticket sales taking into consideration also
the entry into force of two new pieces of EU legislation enhancing consumer
protection since the first sweep checks in September 2007 (Directive on Unfair
Commercial Practices, Air Services Regulation). On the basis of a 14-point
checklist agreed with the airline industry (see MEMO/09/238)
the health check looked at the 7 most important airline websites in all 27
Member States – covering 67 airlines and approximately 339 million
passengers in total. The results of the consultation process carried out by the
Commission on the basis of the findings of the study, including commitments
given by airlines, are summarised below. (see table Annex 1 to press
release)
What happens next?The results of the Health check process have been passed to national
enforcement authorities, to be followed up where necessary 
The Commission is working with the airline industry to put in place an
industry wide agreement to uphold standards, including independent third
party monitoring. 
The Commission will bring forward in June 2009, a Communication on
enforcement, to strengthen the work of the network of national enforcement
authorities (CPC network) after its first two years of operation.

findings have given rise to a political initiative of the Commission in order to
improve compliance with the items on the checklist. These findings and the
follow-up activities of the Commission do not constitute the allegation of an
infringement. Only national enforcement authorities are in a position to
formally investigate infringements.
