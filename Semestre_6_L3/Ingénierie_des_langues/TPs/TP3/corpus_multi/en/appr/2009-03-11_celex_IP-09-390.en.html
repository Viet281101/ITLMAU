Brussels, 11 March 2009Maritime safety: towards better prevention
of maritime accidentsOn 11 March 2009 the European Parliament finally
approved the third package of measures for maritime safety after the agreement
reached in conciliation last December and approval by the Council. 
"I am particularly satisfied with the agreement reached between the
Parliament and the Council. It is a significant step towards improved prevention
of maritime accidents and increased accountability of all the operators in the
sector", said Commission Vice-President Tajani. "This package complements and
updates existing EU legislation and comes as a strong response to the growing
concerns of our citizens," he added.
With this package, the European Union will have a completely overhauled
system for monitoring vessels in its ports. This system will allow a more
frequent and systematic inspection of vessels that pose a risk. It will also
make it possible to definitively ban the worst of them from European ports.
The provisions on granting European recognition to the competent bodies for
certifying vessels on behalf of the Member States will be strengthened. More
rigorous standards will govern the work carried out by classification groups.
These standards will be accompanied by a system of financial penalties and a
certification body for their quality control systems.
The instruments for monitoring traffic along European coasts will be
improved. The SafeSeaNet system will henceforth be the sole medium for all
electronic exchanges of maritime data between the Member States. A European
centre for long-distance vessel monitoring will be set up. Fishing vessels will
be better protected from collisions. The power to make independent decisions on
the accommodation of ships in distress in places of refuge will be
guaranteed.
Independence will also be ensured for investigations following accidents. A
common method of investigation and the creation of a solid database will make it
possible to draw on the lessons learnt from experience to prevent future
accidents.
Preventing accidents is also, and above all, the responsibility of the
vessels' flag authorities. These authorities should be audited in accordance
with the model approved by the International Maritime Organisation and should
hold a quality certificate.
All vessels calling at European ports must be insured. This insurance must be
at the maximum levels for limited liability, those set by the 1996 Convention of
the International Maritime Organisation on the Limitation of Liability for
Maritime Claims (LLMC). Even if this convention does not cover more than 20% of
the world's fleet today, all vessels entering our ports must comply with this
rule.
Lastly, the liability and insurance system provided for in an international
convention on personal damages approved by the International Maritime
Organisation (the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and
their Luggage by Sea) is enshrined in European law. This means there will be
adequate and equal protection for all citizens making international journeys in
four years at the latest. Moreover, this protection will be progressively
extended to cover travel within one single country.
