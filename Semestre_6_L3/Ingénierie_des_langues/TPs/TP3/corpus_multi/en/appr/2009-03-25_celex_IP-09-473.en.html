Brussels, 25 March 2009Mobile use up, consumer prices down:
Europe's telecoms sector weathering economic downturn, says Commission
reportEurope leads the world in mobile phone services
with the number of subscriptions in 2008 at 119% of the EU population (up 7
percentage points from 2007), well ahead of the US (87%) and Japan (84%). This
is a finding of today's Commission progress report on the single telecoms
market. Despite the economic crisis, the EU's telecoms sector (worth about 3% of
EU GDP) continued to grow in 2008 with revenues estimated at above €300
billion, up 1.3% compared to 2007 and outperforming the rest of the economy (up
by 1% only). Consumers gain the most from the sector's competitiveness: they pay
less while getting better value for money. Average mobile phone bills have
fallen from €21.48 to €19.49 in 2008 and 75% of European consumers
now have internet connections of 2 megabits per second and above (speeds
allowing, for example, TV over internet), thanks to EU action. However, the
Commission's report also warns that without better European coordination, the
benefits of a single telecoms market could be jeopardised by inconsistent
national regulation.
"Europe is THE continent of mobile communications, with more and more
people using mobile phones and mobile broadband services. Despite the global
economic crisis, European consumers communicate more than ever with their phones
and via the Internet. This is good news for a sector that can help Europe defy
the downturn," said Viviane Reding, the EU's Telecoms Commissioner. "But
we can't rest on our laurels. We must strengthen national regulators'
independence. We also need fairer competition between fixed and mobile
operators, in view of increasing convergence between fixed and mobile telephony.
Finally, we must prevent a bypassing of EU rules that could harm our single
market. I am in particular concerned that many national regulators are going
their own way on high-speed internet networks. The road to fair competition and
investment in these networks does not lie through 27 different solutions mainly
favouring national champions, but through open markets, legal certainty and
equal chances for all investors and operators."
Today's Commission report is a snapshot of Europe’s telecoms market and
the state of competition in the 27 EU countries. 
Sector growths stronger than rest of economy
Estimated 2008 EU telecoms sector growth is 1.3%, above the overall economy's
1% real GDP growth. It continues to dampen inflation, with prices of most
standard communications (like phone calls or surfing the web) still falling.Mobile: consumers pay 34.5% less than 5 years ago
The mobile market remained the most dynamic telecoms segment in the EU in
2008. Mobile phone use rose from 112% of the population in 2007 to 119% in 2008.
Italy, Lithuania and Luxembourg are over 140%. The leading operators' average
market share fell by around 3% last year, indicating a more competitive market.
As a result, consumers spend more time talking and texting for prices at least
34.5% less than in 2004. 
EU countries global leader in high-speed internet
The number of fixed broadband internet connections in the EU keeps growing:
14 million more in 2008, reaching over 114 million in total. Denmark and the
Netherlands are world leaders in broadband, with take up over 35% of population.
They lead, along with Sweden, Finland, the UK, Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany and
France, the US, which was at 25% in July 2008. 
Mobile broadband is also taking off; with the number of connections now
representing 13% of the EU population. Mobile broadband via data cards and
dongles is becoming a viable alternative to fixed broadband in countries like
Austria (number of connections equivalent to 11.4% of population), Finland
(9.1%) and Portugal (8.3%).
More consumers changing operators 
20.5 million consumers switched phone operators in 2008 while keeping their
fixed or mobile numbers. By October 2008, about 84 million subscribers (17% of
EU citizens) had switched operator since it became possible in 2003. 
Still problems for a single European telecoms market
Today's report also said that divergent regulation in different EU countries
continues to hinder a real single market for telecoms operators and consumers:Independent national telecoms regulators are essential to ensure fair
and effective regulation, but are not yet a reality in all 27 EU countries.
Infringement proceedings launched by the Commission are pending against
Lithuania, Latvia and Romania, while a case against Poland was taken to the
European Court of Justice. 
Inconsistent regulation of similar competition problems can be an
extra burden on telecoms operators, especially the growing number of companies
active in several countries or offering cross-border services.
-		Diverging approaches to the regulation of new fibre networks
could impair competition between operators in the single market and lead to
regulatory uncertainty for new investment. Some regulators' decisions even
appear to be taken in a manner which attempts to bypass EU rules (IP/08/2060).-		There continue to be serious discrepancies between the fees operators
charge each other for connecting calls made from a different network (from
€0.02/min in Cyprus to €0.16/min in Bulgaria.While it takes only 1 day for consumers in Ireland or Malta to change their
mobile operator while keeping their phone number, it still takes 38 days in
Poland, 15 in Italy and 14 in Slovakia.A press pack with the
