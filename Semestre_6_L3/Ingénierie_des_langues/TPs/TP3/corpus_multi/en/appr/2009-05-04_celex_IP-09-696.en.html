Brussels, 4 May 2009Internet Governance: EU Commissioner Reding
calls for full privatisation and full accountability of ICANN as of 1
OctoberIn a video posted on her website this morning,
Viviane Reding, EU- Commissioner for Information Society and Media, called for
greater transparency and accountability in Internet Governance as of October
2009. Key decisions related to Internet Governance, like top level domains and
managing the internet's core directory, are currently made by the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a private not-for profit
corporation established in California. So far, ICANN has been operating under an
agreement with the US Department of Commerce. However, this agreement expires on
30 September this year. For the time after, Commissioner Reding today outlined a
new governance model for the internet. This would include a fully private and
accountable ICANN, accompanied by an independent judicial body, as well as a
"G12 for Internet Governance" – a multilateral forum for governments to
discuss general internet governance policy and security issues. 
"I trust that President Obama will have the courage, the wisdom and the
respect for the global nature of the internet to pave the way in September for a
new, more accountable, more transparent, more democratic and more multilateral
form of Internet Governance," said EU Commissioner Viviane Reding in
her Internet video message this morning. "The time to act is now. And Europe
will be ready to support President Obama in his efforts." 
Reding stressed that "a moment of truth will come on 30 September this
year, when the current agreement between ICANN and the US Government expires.
This opens the door for the full privatisation of ICANN; and it also raises the
question of to whom ICANN should be accountable, as from 1 October."
ICANN deals with some of most sensitive issues related to Internet
Governance, such as top level domains or management of the internet address
system that ensures that millions of computers can connect to each other. ICANN
was established in 1998 in California, under an agreement with the US
government.
"Accountability of ICANN is a must," said Reding. "The Clinton
administration's decision to progressively privatize the internet's domain name
and addressing system is the right one. In the long run, it is not defendable
that the government department of only one country has oversight of an internet
function which is used by hundreds of millions of people in countries all over
the world."
EU Commissioner Reding also outlined how a new model of Internet
Governance could be shaped after 30 September. It could include in
particular the following:A fully privatised and independent ICANN complying with the best
standards of corporate governance, in particular with those on financial
transparency and internal accountability, and subject to effective judicial
review.
 A multilateral forum where governments can discuss general internet
governance policy issues, such as a "G12 for Internet Governance" –
an informal group of government representatives that meets at least twice a year
and can make, by majority, recommendations to ICANN where appropriate. This
group would provide swift reaction in case of threats to the stability, security
and openness of the internet. To be geographically balanced, this "G-12 for
Internet Governance" would include two representatives from each North America,
South America, Europe and Africa, three representatives from Asia and Australia,
as well as the Chairman of ICANN as a non-voting member. International
Organisations with competences in this field could be given observer
status.On 6 May, the European Commission will host a first public
hearing in Brussels to give Europe's Internet Community a chance to voice their
expectations for the future of Internet Governance.
Background
For many years, the European Union has played a major role in international
discussions on Internet Governance. The European Commission has repeatedly
called for a system of internet governance fully entrusted to the private sector
without government interference in the internet's day-to-day management (see IP/06/1297)
and has been supporting an open multi-stakeholder policy dialogue on internet
governance and development (IP/06/1491).
The European Commission also participates in the Governmental Advisory Committee of the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), whose main purpose is to
advise ICANN on public policy aspects of its coordination activities.
