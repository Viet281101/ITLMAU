Brussels, 3 April 2009EU translation contest winners receive their
prizesTwenty-seven students from EU secondary schools
will each receive a prize and a diploma in Brussels today for producing the best
translations in their respective countries in the “Juvenes
Translatores” (‘young translators’ in Latin) translation
contest. The prizes will be presented by Leonard Orban, the European
Commissioner for Multilingualism. The contest was organised in November 2008 by
the European Commission to promote language learning and to give visibility to
the profession of translator. 	.
“Once again, this translation contest has been truly successful in
bringing people together and raising awareness of language learning,
translation and the unique multilingual nature of the EU,” is how Mr Orban
put it. “We have heard that some contestants are now seriously
considering translation as a career option, and some of the schools
taking part have initiated exchange projects.” 
 The victorious students won a two-day trip to Brussels for themselves and an
accompanying adult. In addition to the award ceremony hosted by
Commissioner Orban, the winners will be going on a tour of Brussels and
visiting the Directorate-General for Translation of the European
Commission. There they will meet professional translators, and see the tools and
working methods that translators use in their day-to-day work.
Anyone interested – be they schools, teachers or friends – can
watch the award ceremony via web streaming. The link for viewing the
event will be active on the Juvenes Translatores website:

2 247 selected pupils from 593 schools in the EU took part in the
second edition of the contest, held on 27 November 2008 at the same time in all
Member States. The participants had two hours to translate a text on the subject
of multilingualism from any of the 23 official languages of the EU into any
other official language. The translations submitted to the Commission covered
all official languages and 147 language combinations. 
The second contest was organised on the back of the huge success of the first
contest held in 2007. A survey carried out among language teachers right after
the contest provided equally enthusiastic feedback. “Juvenes
Translatores” is set to become a regular event of the school year. Thus,
preparations for the third round are already under way.
