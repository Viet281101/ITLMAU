Brussels, 15 May 2009All EU countries to celebrate European
Maritime Day in Rome, 18-20 MayThe sea has always played a key role in Europe's
prosperity. Our continent has almost 70 000 km of coastline and 22 of the
EU’s 27 Member States are coastal or island countries. Our maritime
regions are home to 40% of our population, generate 40% of our economy and
employ some 5 million people. For all these reasons, 20 May is a dedicated
"European Maritime Day" in the EU. This year, in cooperation with the Italian
government, the Commission is organising a 3-day conference in Rome from 18 to
20 May. This important event brings together stakeholders, administrations and
other players from the European Union and this time also from a number of third
countries, in particular from the Mediterranean region, to discuss the global
challenges faced by maritime Europe today. European Maritime Day was set up as
one of the key actions of the EU's Integrated Maritime Policy, launched in
2007.
"On 20 May, we celebrate the annual European Maritime Day in Rome",
Commission President José Manuel Barroso said. "European citizens are
increasingly aware of the importance of our common maritime heritage and future.
Our Integrated Maritime Policy reflects a clear vision of how to address the
challenges of maritime prosperity, sustainability and security and is intimately
tied to the fight against climate change and to recovering the economic
competitiveness of Europe."
According to Joe Borg, European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and
Fisheries, "The EU's Integrated Maritime Policy puts maritime sectors and
coastal regions, traditionally at the periphery, at the centre of a new, dynamic
and inclusive policy for sustainable growth and jobs. The EU and its Member
States are convinced that specificities of oceans, seas and coasts need to be
addressed in a coordinated and coherent manner. In Rome, institutions and
stakeholders will debate new approaches to managing our oceans, seas and coastal
regions sustainably under the umbrella of one all-embracing integrated policy
strategy."
The Maritime Day stakeholders’ conference in Rome will bring together
stakeholders from business and civil society, decision-makers and journalists
from across the EU and beyond, to discuss a wide range of policies and
practices, such as integrated maritime governance, emerging technologies, energy
generation, planning of the maritime space, surveillance systems for the seas,
sustainable coastal tourism, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and
others. The views raised at the conference will feed into the future development
of the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy. 
Also in Rome, before and after the conference, stakeholder organisations will
be holding a number of workshops and presentations on themes linked to the
conference agenda. In addition to the central conference in Rome, around 40
events will be held in Member States across the European Union. These local
events vary from conferences or workshops to open days at ports and
environmental projects. 
The programme of the Rome conference includes keynote speeches by Italian
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, the Czech Presidency of the European Union,
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, and the Vice-President
of the European Parliament Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou. The two hosts of the
conference are the European Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Joe
Borg, and the Italian Minister of Infrastructures and Transport,  Altero
Matteoli. The European Commission will be further represented by its
Vice-President in charge of enterprise policy and industry, Günter
Verheugen, and its Vice-President in charge of transport, Antonio Tajani. 
Italy’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Franco Frattini, will also address
the conference. A series of panel discussions will take stock of the
achievements of the Integrated Maritime Policy since its launch and debate the
further way ahead.
Following the European Commission’s proposal for an Integrated Maritime
Policy in October 2007 and its subsequent endorsement by Heads of State and
Government in December 2007, tangible progress has been made towards building a
coherent framework to promote synergies and resolve potential conflicts between
different sea-related policy areas. In line with the Action Plan published in
October 2007, the Commission has already come forward with a package of
proposals to, for example, boost maritime research and develop EU ports, promote
maritime spatial planning and a maritime transport space without barriers, and
boost offshore wind energy production. Other proposals have identified
strategies to adapt to climate change, provide support to sea and maritime
transport workers, or lay out approaches for an integrated maritime governance.
In the fisheries sector, the Commission has put forward new legislation to
combat illegal fishing, to improve control and enforcement and  it has also
launched an EU-wide consultation exercise on a fundamental reform of the Common
Fisheries Policy.
