Brussels, 22 January 2009Substantial progress on innovation in
EuropeThe 2008 European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS)
published today shows the EU making substantial progress in its innovation
performance preceding the financial crisis. The relative innovation gap with the
US and Japan was reduced, in particular amid strong progress by many new Member
States such as Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria. Across the EU, particular progress
was made in human resources and availability of finance for innovation. However,
innovative investments by businesses are still relatively weak especially if
compared to the US and Japan. In parallel to this report, the 2008Science,
Technology and Competitiveness report provides a more in-depth analysis of
trends in public and business R&amp;D,, technological performance and progress
in implementing the European Research Area
"In a time of crisis, it is not the moment to take a break in research
investments and in innovation. They are vital if Europe wants to emerge
stronger from the economic crisis and if it wants to address the challenges of
climate change and globalisation. The EU does have many assets, notably an
increasingly attractive European research area and a continuously improving
innovation performance. But there is still work to be done, especially on the
relative underinvestment by business. The Commission's initiatives to improve
the EU's research efficiency, to stimulate innovation and to develop high tech
markets are putting the EU on the right tracks", emphasised Vice President
Günter Verheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy, and Janez
Potočnik, the Research Commissioner.
The report shows that European countries form four groupings at
different levels of performance, and that virtually all countries have improved
their performance although the rate of progress varies:Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Denmark and the UK are Innovation
leaders, with innovation performance well above the EU average. Of these
countries, Switzerland and Germany are improving their performance fastest.Austria, Ireland, Luxembourg, Belgium, France and the Netherlands are
Innovation followers, with performance above the EU average. Ireland's
performance has been increasing fastest within this group, followed by
Austria.
Cyprus, Iceland, Estonia, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Norway, Spain, Portugal,
Greece and Italy are the Moderate innovators, with innovation performance
below the EU average. The trend in Cyprus' innovation performance is well above
the average for this group, followed by Portugal.
Malta, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Croatia, Romania, Latvia,
Bulgaria and Turkey are the Catching-up countries with innovation
performance well below the EU average. Most of these countries have been
catching up.  Bulgaria and Romania have been improving their performance the
fastest.For individual summaries of the innovation performance
of all 27 Member States see MEMO/09/18.
Innovation performance (2008 Summary Innovation Index)
[ Figures and graphics available in PDF and WORD PROCESSED ]
Note: The Summary Innovation Index (SII) is a composite of 29 indicators
going from a lowest possible performance of 0 to a maximum possible performance
of 1. The 2008 SII reflects performance in 2006/2007 due to a lag in data
availability.
Closing the innovation gap with the US and Japan
The analysis of EU level data shows that there have been substantial
improvements both in absolute terms (compared to five years ago), and relative
to the US and Japan. A comparison with a broader range of countries also shows
that the EU has fared relatively well with respect to emerging economies. There
has been a particular progress in human resources for innovation (graduates,
tertiary education); broad-band access and in availability of venture capital.
However, weaknesses persist in business investment where the EU is behind the US
and Japan on R&amp;D and IT expenditures. Also, despite the reports' finding
about the importance of non-technological innovation, expenditure by EU
companies on such innovative activities (e.g. training, design, marketing, new
equipment) has declined.
Innovation as a recipe for economic recovery
The EIS analysis is based on data that precede the financial crisis. However,
they point to existing trends, strengths and weaknesses that need to be taken
into account in responding to current conditions. The progress made by the EU
prior the financial crisis has put European entrepreneurs in a better position
to recover through innovation. However, the persistent business under-investment
in innovation as compared to main competitors is a clear weakness which needs to
be tackled, including through renewed public support to innovative companies
such as the Lead Markets Initiative (see IP/08/12)
which fosters market demand for new products and services. 
Further lessons come from the Innovation Progress Report which was published
alongside the EIS and presents independent expert analysis of developments in
national innovation policies and governance, building on country reports
prepared by independent experts and available on the internet site of the PRO
INNO initiative. This shows a trend towards support for innovative start-ups and
strategies which address new challenges such as climate change and resource
productivity.
The findings of the reports will be used by the European Commission to help
assess the success of current innovation policies and identify future
priorities.
Background information:
Commissioned by the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry of the
European Commission, the EIS is prepared by the Maastricht Economic and social
Research and training centre on Innovation and Technology (UNU-MERIT) and the
Innovation Progress Report by a consortium of experts led by the University of
Athens and Technopolis Group.
