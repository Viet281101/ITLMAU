Brussels, 18 February 2009Setting up of European Asylum Support Office
proposed by the CommissionThe Commission today adopted a proposal for a
Regulation to establish a European Asylum Support Office. This proposal is
presented under the Pact on Immigration and Asylum in response to a request by
the European Council. What is proposed is the speedy establishment of an
operational agency to coordinate and step up cooperation on asylum between
Member States, so helping to harmonise different national practices. The Office
will also help to align existing asylum rules in the EU.  
Commission Vice-President Jacques Barrot, responsible for freedom, security
and justice, said: "We are actively working to put in place the Common European
Asylum System. In this context, it is essential that we align not only our laws
but also our practices. The asylum authorities of the Member States have crucial
need of material support for their day-to-day operational requirements. Support
teams deployed by the Office will also help to find solutions to emergency
situations, such as a mass influx of asylum seekers."
Current practice in the implementation of the right of asylum illustrates the
fact that there are major differences in the way Member States deal with
applications for international protection. For example, an Iraqi has a 71%
chance of obtaining protection in one Member State but only a 2% chance in
another. The Policy Plan on Asylum adopted by the Commission in June 2008
proposed an ambitious extension and overhaul of European legislation on asylum.
This work is in progress but needs to be underpinned by a stepping-up of
administrative cooperation between the Member States with a view to aligning
national practices. 
The Office will support Member States in their efforts to implement a more
consistent and fairer asylum policy, for example by helping to identify good
practices, organising training at European level and improving access to
accurate information on countries of origin. It will also be responsible for
coordinating support teams made up of national experts that will be deployed at
the request of Member States faced with a mass influx of asylum seekers into
their territory. It will also provide scientific and technical assistance for
the development of asylum policy and legislation.
The Office will be set up in the form of an agency, an independent European
body. The Commission and the Member States will be represented on the Management
Board, which will be the Office's governing body. The Office will work closely
with the authorities responsible for asylum in the Member States and with the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There will also be
a Consultative Forum for dialogue with civil society organisations. 
If the proposal is adopted quickly, the Office could be up and running by
2010. Its headquarters will be established in an EU Member State by decision of
the Heads of State and Government.
