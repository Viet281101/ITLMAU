Brussels, 1 April 2009Adapting to climate change: the European
Union must prepare for the impacts to comeThe European Commission presented today a White
Paper outlining actions needed to strengthen the Union's resilience in coping
with a changing climate. Recent findings indicate that the impacts of climate
change will be swifter and more severe than indicated by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change in their 2007 report. Europe will not escape these
effects and must therefore prepare to cope with them.  The impact of climate
change will have varying regional implications meaning that most adaptation
measures will need to be taken nationally and regionally. The framework
presented by the Commission sets out a two-phase strategic approach to adapting
to the impacts of climate change in the EU which complements actions taken by
Member States through an integrated and coordinated approach.
European Commissioner for the Environment Stavros Dimas said: "The
seriousness of climate change is becoming greater and more disturbing with each
passing year. We must work hard to reduce carbon emissions, but even with the
emission reductions we are committed to achieving, some amount of climate change
is inevitable. It is therefore essential that we start work now with
governments, business, and communities to develop a comprehensive adaptation
strategy for the EU and to ensure that adaptation is integrated into key EU
policies."
Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel said: "European agriculture
will feel the full force of climate change. I want to give farmers a clear
understanding of the challenges they will face, and I want to launch discussions
about specific steps to help our farmers to adapt. In particular, I want to see
us take "no regret" measures which will bring economic and environmental
dividends no matter how the climate develops. These are the key elements of the
paper on agriculture and climate change that has been adopted today in support
to the White Paper"
Health Commissioner Androula Vassiliou said: "With changing climate patterns,
particular attention needs to be paid to the strengthening of human, animal and
plant health surveillance. In addition, integrating extreme weather health
action plans into the preparedness planning of health authorities is crucial. We
also need to ensure that the effects of climate change on vulnerable social
groups are assessed. International collaboration is vital in achieving these
aims."
Maritime and fisheries affairs Commissioner Joe Borg said: "Europe's coasts
and marine areas are in the frontline of climate change. We need to get ready to
face coming challenges such as rising sea-levels, coastal flooding, the impact
on coastal tourism and on ports and shipping, and also on fisheries. We cannot
deny the importance of coastal ecosystems to our economy. Today, around 50% of
the European population lives in coastal areas, therefore efforts to adapt to
climate change are crucial and urgent".  
A framework for action
Over the next 50 years climate change is likely to have profound effects on
important economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport, ecosystems,
tourism and health. It will also affect households and businesses and certain
sectors of society, notably the elderly, the disabled and low-income
households.
The White Paper presents a framework within which the European Union and its
Member States can prepare for the impacts of climate change.  A first phase of
the strategy will run until 2012 and will lay the groundwork for preparing a
comprehensive EU adaptation strategy from 2013 and beyond. It will focus on
increasing our understanding of climate change and possible adaptation measures
and how adaptation can be embedded in key EU policies. Decisions on how best to
adapt must be based on solid scientific and economic analysis, yet information
content and availability differs widely across regions.  The paper outlines the
need for a Clearing House Mechanism in which to exchange information on climate
change risks, impacts and best practices. 
Impacts of climate change will vary by region, with coastal and mountain
areas and flood plains particularly vulnerable. It is for this reason that most
adaptation measures will be carried out nationally or regionally. The role of
the European Union will be to support these efforts through an integrated and
coordinated approach, particularly in cross-border issues and policies which are
highly integrated at EU level. Naturally, climate change adaptation will need to
be at the heart of all EU policies. Adaptation must also feature prominently in
the Union's external policies to assist those countries most affected and
cooperate on international adaptation issues with partner countries.
The Commission is also presenting today three discussion papers on water,
coasts and marine, agricultural and health issues based on the framework set out
in the White Paper.
Adapting and mitigating, two sides of the same coin
The European Union is determined to take swift action to reduce its
greenhouse emissions. But mitigating climate change by curbing greenhouse gas
emissions is not enough. It needs a complementary response in the shorter term.
The consequences of climate change are expected to be more substantial than
expected and will occur regardless of the mitigation measures that are
implemented. 
Europe must deal with these effects. It needs measures to increase the
resilience of natural and human systems to impacts of climate change. Adaptation
policies are being carried out in the EU, but are often implemented in a
piecemeal fashion and only in a few Member States. 
Future actionThe Commission will set up an Impact and Adaptation
Steering Group (IASG). It will be composed of representatives from EU Member
States involved in the drawing up of national and regional adaptation programmes
and will consult with representatives from civil society and the scientific
community. It will be supported by technical working groups, including one on
agriculture. By 2011 the Commission will establish a Clearing House Mechanism
for exchange information on climate change impacts.
