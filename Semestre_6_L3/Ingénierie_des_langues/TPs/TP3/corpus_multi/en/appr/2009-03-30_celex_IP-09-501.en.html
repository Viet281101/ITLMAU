Brussels, 30 March 2009The Commission welcomes today's political
endorsement by the Council of the Single European Sky packageAfter the positive vote in the European Parliament
last week, the Transport Ministers confirmed today the agreement reached on a
far reaching aviation package. This package, which will be formally adopted by
the Council in the weeks to come, strengthens the Single European Sky, makes the
European Aviation Safety Agency responsible for all safety links of the aviation
chain and boosts the implementation of new technologies. As a package, these
measures will deliver safer, greener and more cost-efficient flights. Annual
savings for the airlines is calculated around four billion euros. At the same
time the ATM Master Plan will put the European manufacturing industry at the
forefront of innovation in air traffic management technology, thus delivering a
performing European infrastructure and giving manufacturers a competitive edge
on global markets.
Commission Vice-President responsible for transport, Antonio Tajani, said:
"Europe needs an air traffic management system that is able to cope with future
growth of aviation. The travelling public expects high quality services. This
package of measures will deliver safer, greener and more cost-efficient flights.
Aircraft will be able to fly the shortest routes possible in line with growing
environmental requirements. For the first time, the needs of the airspace users
are put at the core of the system.  The package could not have come at a more
opportune moment, when the sector is in difficulty due to the present crisis.
"
The first pillar of the package introduces several enhancements to the
original SES legislation (see IP/01/1398), including binding performance
targets for air navigation service providers, European network management
functions to ensure convergence between national networks and a definitive date
for Member States to improve performance, including through a process of
enhanced cooperation and further integration of air navigation service
providers, known as Functional Airspace Blocks.
The technological pillar focuses on introducing state-of-the-art
technology. The SESAR programme brings together all aviation stakeholders to
develop, validate and deploy a new generation, Europe-wide air traffic
management system. 
The safety pillar provides for increased responsibilities for the
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). This would ensure precise, uniform and
binding rules for airport operation, air traffic management and air navigation
services, as well as sound oversight of their implementation by Member States.
These new EASA competences provide the agency with a more comprehensive control
on European aviation safety, and ensure that common safety rules are applied in
all phases of flight, starting from the tarmac.
Finally, the airport capacity pillar tackles the shortage of runways
and airport facilities, which currently threatens to become a major bottleneck.
The initiative seeks to co-ordinate better airport slots issued to aircraft
operators with air traffic management measures as well as the establishment of
an airport capacity observatory to fully integrate airports in the aviation
network.
The new package places environmental issues at the core of the Single
European Sky and improved air traffic management aims at reducing greenhouse gas
emissions from aviation. Prospective improvements are up to 10% per flight,
which amounts to 16 million tons of CO2 savings per year and annual
cost savings for airspace users of â‚¬ 2.4 billion. This will put aviation
in a position to deal with its integration in the European Emission Trading
Scheme.Given the central human factor in air navigation service provision,
the European institutions have also adopted a statement to declare their
willingness to work jointly to involve staff in to the implementation of the
aviation package, to ensure high standards of competence all categories of
personnel delivering safety and to boost confidence in incident reporting
mechanisms.
