Brussels, 4 March 2009Publication of the General Report on the
EU's activities in 2008The Commission has published the General Report on
the activities of the European Union in 2008.  Last year was marked in
particular by the global financial crisis, climate change and international
conflict, all of which brought rapid and effective European reaction that pushed
the Union to the forefront of the world political stage. The key institutional
event of the year was the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, which faltered
in spring with the 'no' vote in the Irish referendum, but was revived at the
European Council in December.
Marking the publication of the 2008 General Report, President Barroso said:
"Fifty years on, the European institutions proved their ability to respond
rapidly to the global challenges that arose in 2008. In its tenth anniversary
year, Economic and Monetary Union also demonstrated the protection provided by
the euro in the face of a worldwide financial crisis."
The General Report covers the work of all the EU institutions and bodies and
seeks to provide an overview of the notable events and key trends of EU life in
2008.
The year 2008 threw up many major challenges, to which the Member States and
the institutions responded as a group. The Union took a leading role in working
towards a genuine complete overhaul of the international financial system. To
deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the European economies, the
Union adopted emergency measures to coordinate the European response to this
global crisis. The European economic recovery plan recommends short-term
measures to boost demand, thereby saving jobs and helping to restore confidence.
It also calls for a timely, targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus of around
EUR 200 billion or 1.5% of the Union’s gross domestic
product.
The institutions demonstrated strong commitment on the other big initiative
of 2008 – the shaping of a European energy policy that would take account
of climate change. An agreement was reached at the December European Council on
the ambitious package of measures on energy and climate aimed at enabling the
Union to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% and increase the share
of renewable energies in energy consumption to 20% by 2020.
Ratification of the Lisbon Treaty was another key item on the 2008 agenda.
The referendum held in Ireland on 12 June — Ireland was the only
country to hold a referendum — produced a 'no' vote of 53.4%. A way
forward was nevertheless found: the Union would make legally binding
declarations clarifying the aspects of the Treaty that had given rise to concern
in Ireland, where a further referendum would be held in the course of 2009 and
before the end of the current Commission's term of office.
External policy figured prominently on the European agenda in 2008, from the
'Union for the Mediterranean' plan, to the partnership with the countries of
Eastern Europe and development of the 'Black Sea synergy' initiative. Other
priorities for the Union included resolution of the open conflict in Georgia and
of the problem of energy supply security.
Totalling some 250
pages, the Report sets out developments in the different fields of activity
according to the four strategic objectives adopted by the Commission at the
beginning of its term of office: prosperity, solidarity, security, and Europe's
role as a world partner. Three other chapters are devoted to the life of the
institutions and other bodies, the budget and financial activities and the
general policy and economic framework. This section highlights progress made in
2008 in key areas such as improving regulation and reducing the administrative
burdens on businesses.
The General Report is published in 22 official languages and can be consulted
via the internet on the EU's Europa website: http://europa.eu/generalreport/en/welcome.htm.
It will shortly be available from the sales offices for European Union
publications.
