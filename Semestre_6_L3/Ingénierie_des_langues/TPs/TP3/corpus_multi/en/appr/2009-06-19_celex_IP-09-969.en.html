IP/09/969 Brussels, 19 June 2009 Green Week 2009: Climate change – act and adapt With a new international climate agreement due to be finalised at the Copenhagen conference in December, climate change is the natural focus for the European Commission's Green Week 2009 conference taking place from 23 to 26 June at the Charlemagne Building in Brussels. Under the slogan 'act and adapt', Green Week, the biggest annual conference devoted to European environment policy, will examine the multi-faceted challenges of reducing EU and global greenhouse gas emissions and of adapting to the climate change that is already under way. Eight of the sessions will also try to come up with a realistic vision of how a low-carbon world in 2050 would look. Over 4,000 participants from Europe and beyond are expected at the three-day event. Commission President José Manuel Barroso will give the keynote speech at the closing session on 26 June, which will look ahead at prospects for the Copenhagen agreement. Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: "With the Copenhagen conference coming up, 2009 has the potential to go down in history as a turning point in the battle to prevent climate change from reaching dangerous levels and causing human misery on a vast scale. Green Week’s comprehensive programme will enable participants to share knowledge about a wide range of aspects of the climate challenge that policy-makers, economic operators and society in general need to be addressing now.” Four themes, 36 sessions Now in its ninth year, the Green Week conference and associated exhibition has established itself as a major annual forum for dialogue and for sharing experience, expertise and best practice in protecting the environment. Green Week brings together participants from different levels of government, international institutions, business, non-governmental organisations and the scientific and academic communities. The objective is to discuss the most effective ways to protect and improve Europe's environment for current and future generations. The event is open to all participants free of charge. More than 4,000 participants have registered so far. Green Week 2009 looks at climate change under four headings: EU climate change policies; the international dimension; living with climate change; and '2050 vision: a carbon-free society.' The programme comprises 36 conference sessions, some organised in partnership with the Brussels think-tank Friends of Europe, plus a small number of additional side sessions. The broad spectrum of issues that will be covered includes implementation of the EU climate and energy package, the impact of climate change on employment and social cohesion, how biodiversity can adapt to climate change, 'greening' the economy, the challenge for agriculture, the international security dimension and latest developments in carbon capture and storage. Commissioner Dimas will speak at the high-level opening session, as well as at the closing session focusing on 'The Road to Copenhagen.' Besides President Barroso, the other speakers at the closing session will be Swedish Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren and Professor Wang Yi of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
