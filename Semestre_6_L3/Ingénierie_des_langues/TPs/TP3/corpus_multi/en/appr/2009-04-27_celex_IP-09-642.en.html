Brussels, 27 April 2009Barca Report: Commissioner Danuta
Hübner and Fabrizio Barca present reform proposals for EU Cohesion
PolicyDanuta Hübner, European Commissioner for
Regional Policy, and Fabrizio Barca, Director General in Italy's Ministry of
Finance and Economy, today present the findings of the "Barca Report - an agenda
for a reformed Cohesion Policy". The report, requested by the Commissioner, sets
out the rationale for a European Cohesion Policy and puts forward
recommendations for a comprehensive reform based on ten "pillars". Doctor
Barca's proposals have been developed in full independence from the Commission,
with input from academic experts and Member State officials following a series
of meetings held throughout 2008. The report is part of a thorough
reflection process on the future policy post-2013, which began in
2007 with the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion. 
Commissioner Hübner said: "The Barca Report confirms that the
Cohesion Policy is a central pillar of the European integration process. It
recognises that all regions should be able to realise their potential in terms
of economic development and that all citizens should benefit from the policy,
wherever they live. The report confirms that the reforms we have already
introduced over the past few years are the correct ones. It also opens new, bold
avenues which will widen our perspective on the renewal of the policy."
Fabrizio Barca emphasised: "The review of facts and theory conducted by
the report shows that the Union needs a policy for economic and social
development tailored to the specific needs of very diverse places. It must be
capable of enhancing opportunities and tackling the challenges facing EU
citizens created by the unification of markets. A reformed Cohesion Policy can
fulfil this through advanced methodologies, a strong focus on results and modern
multilevel governance."
The report's recommendations for reform are based on ten
“pillars”:
1: Concentration on core priorities 
Dr Barca says the EU should concentrate around 65% of its funding on three or
four core priorities, with the share varying between Member States and regions
according to needs and strategies. Criteria for the allocation of funding would
remain much as now (i.e. based on GDP per capita). One or two core priorities
should address social inclusion to allow for the development of a
"territorialised social agenda". 
2: A new strategic framework 
The strategic dialogue between the Commission and Member States (or Regions
in some cases) should be enhanced and based on a European Strategic
Development Framework, setting out clear-cut principles, indicators and
targets for assessing performance.
3: A new contractual relationship, implementation and
reporting
The Commission and Member States should develop a new type of contractual
agreement (a National Strategic Development Contract), focused on
performance and verifiable commitments.
4: Strengthened governance for core priorities
The Commission should establish a set of “conditionalities” for
national institutions as a requirement for allocating funding to specific
priorities and should assess progress in meeting targets. 
5: Promoting additional, innovative and flexible spending
The Commission should strengthen the principle of "additionality", which
ensures that Member States do not substitute national with EU expenditure, by
establishing a direct link with the Stability and Growth Pact. A contractual
commitment is needed to ensure that measures are innovative and add value.
6: Promoting experimentation and mobilising local actors 
The Commission and Member States should encourage experimentation, and a
better balance between creating an incentive for local involvement in policies
and preventing the policy from being “hijacked” by interest groups.7: Promoting the learning process: a move towards prospective impact
evaluation
Better design and implementation of methods for estimating what outcomes
would have been had intervention not taken place would improve understanding of
what works where, and exert a disciplinary effect when actions are
designed.
8: Strengthening the role of the Commission as a centre of competenceDevelop more specialised expertise in the Commission with greater
coordination between Directorate-Generals to match the enhanced role and
discretion of the Commission in the policy. This would imply significant
investment in human resources and organisational changes.
9: Addressing financial management and control 
Achieve greater efficiency in administering the Structural Funds by pursuing
the ongoing simplification agenda and considering other means of reducing costs
and the burden imposed on the Commission, the Member States and
beneficiaries.
10: Reinforcing the high-level political system of checks and
balances
A stronger system of checks and balances between the Commission, the European
Parliament and the Council, through the creation of a formal Council for
Cohesion Policy. Encourage an ongoing debate on the content, results and impact
of the Cohesion Policy.
