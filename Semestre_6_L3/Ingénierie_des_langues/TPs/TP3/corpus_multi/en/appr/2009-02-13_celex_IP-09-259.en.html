Brussels, 13 February 2009Regions must 'network for results' to tackle
financial crisis, climate change and energy fears, says Danuta
HübnerOn Monday 16 February, Regional Policy Commissioner
Danuta Hübner will open the annual "Regions for Economic Change"
conference, launched by the Commission in 2006. The two-day event will provide
an opportunity for more than 800 representatives from Europe's regions to share
ideas and showcase their contribution to competitiveness, growth and jobs, One
of the highlights of the event will be the announcement on Monday evening of the
winners of the 2009 'RegioStars' Awards, celebrating the most inspiring and
innovative projects funded by the EU's Cohesion Policy.
"The theme of this year's conference 'Networking for results' could hardly be
more apt at a time when European regions are confronted with multiple global
challenges - the financial crisis, climate change and energy supply to name but
a few. Through Cohesion Policy networks, we can promote and mainstream good
practice and experience in the regions so everybody can benefit,” said
Commissioner Hübner.
Regions will present examples of good practice in nine workshops covering the
following thematic areas: water management, broadband access, immigration in
cities, creativity and innovation, industrial reorganisation, the impact of
climate change at the regional level, innovation fast track' networks, satellite
information services and the Lisbon Monitoring Platform, which assesses the EU
strategy for growth and jobs.
Cyril Svoboda, Minister for Regional Development, representing the Czech
Presidency of the European Union, Luc Van den Brande President of the Committee
of the Regions, and Ján Figel', Commissioner for Education, Training and
Culture, will also address the conference. 
In an evening event on 16 February, Commissioner Hübner and the
President of the Jury, Job Cohen, Mayor of Amsterdam, will present the 2009
'RegioStars' awards to successful and innovative regional policy projects. Some
52 projects from 18 countries entered for this year's awards, which focus on
three main categories:research, technological development and innovation,;
Adaptation to or mitigation of climate change;
Audiovisual spot or programme highlighting the contribution of Cohesion
Policy.Examples of existing networks of regions and citiesSince 2006, several networks of regions, supported by the European Commission
under the Regions for Economic Change initiative, have developed,
including:
B3 REGIONS, a network led by the
Piedmont region (Italy). It tackles a key issue for the development of the
knowledge economy: implementing connections in remote or disadvantaged
areas.
RAPIDE, coordinated by the South
West England Regional Development Agency (UK), deals with the role of the public
sector in stimulating innovation in regions, in particular helping small
businesses bring innovative products to market more quickly. This network
gathers 12 European regions.
HerO, led by Regensburg (Germany), is a
network of 10 cities which aims to promote sustainable management strategies
for historical urban landscapes.
Note for editors
The conference is organised by the European Commission in partnership with
the Committee of the Regions. The aim of the Regions for Economic Change
initiative is to enable experience and good practice in Europe's regions to be
shared as widely as possible, and exploited fully to promote competitiveness,
growth and jobs. 
During the period 2007-2013, funding of €375 million is available under
Cohesion Policy for networking and learning activities under the "Interregional
cooperation" strand.
