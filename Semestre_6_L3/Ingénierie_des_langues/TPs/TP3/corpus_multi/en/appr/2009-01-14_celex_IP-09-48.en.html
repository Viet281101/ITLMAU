Brussels, 14 January 2009.eu domain passes the 3 million
markThe third million .eu domain name was registered on
11 January by a German citizen. Two and a half years after its launch, this
confirms the success of the .eu top-level internet domain. It is the fourth most
popular internet domain among European country domains and the ninth worldwide.
By promoting a distinctly European online identity .eu helps citizens and
businesses to reap the full benefits of the single market. Multinational
companies and SMEs, NGOs and think tanks as well as individual Europeans have
all adopted .eu to mark their web presence. 
"The three million .eu domains reflect the confidence of European internet
users in .eu," said Viviane Reding, EU Commissioner for Information Society
and Media. "This achievement, just a few months before its third
anniversary, indicates how .eu has clearly won public favour: a growing number
of internet users are embracing the opportunity to express their European
character online. In particular, I am glad to see that an increasing number of
small and medium-sized companies have adopted .eu as an integral part of their
corporate identity and I am looking forward to seeing more companies taking
advantage of .eu in the future."  
By reaching the third million domain, .eu has well consolidated its place
among the ten largest top-level domains in the world, such as .com, .net. and
.org. Registrations for .eu domains have been steadily growing since its
introduction in 2006. In addition, .eu domains enjoy a good reputation: a recent
survey
carried out for EURid, the registry
for .eu, shows that users not only perceive .eu as the genuine European internet
identity, but also believe that .eu domains are innovative and modern. 
Most .eu domains have been registered in EU countries with the largest
populations and highest internet penetration. Germany continues to lead with
30%, followed by the Netherlands (14%), the United Kingdom (12%), France (8%)
and Poland (6%). 
Background
.eu first opened on 7 December 2005 to holders of prior rights (IP/05/1510).
Since early April 2006, registration has been open to all EU residents and
organisations with a registered seat in the EU (IP/06/476).
Management of the .eu registry (the database holding all .eu registrations) is
entrusted to EURid, an independent
not-for-profit organisation. By its first anniversary, 2.5 million .eu domain
names had been registered (IP/07/483),
another 300,000 domain names were added in 2007 (IP/08/530).
