Brussels, 27 April 2009European Commission launches competition to
create a new EU organic logoOrganic food meets fresh design: The European
Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development is
inviting all design and art students from the 27 EU Member States to enter the
EU-wide organic logo competition. The competition offers a prize that money just
can’t buy: The winning logo will be introduced as the official logo for
organic products throughout the European Union in July 2010. On the eve of the
organic logo competition launch, Mariann Fischer Boel, European Commissioner for
Agriculture and Rural Development, said: "The new organic logo will bring
identity to the organic sector in the EU. It will help in creating the single
market, and that's good news for producers and consumers."
With the goal of designing a clever and creative EU organic logo, the EU
gives Europe’s up-and-coming talents the chance to create a design that
could be printed on millions of product packages. The new EU organic logo will
be mandatory for all pre-packaged organic products that originate in the 27
Member States and meet the labelling standards. Additionally, all non
pre-packaged organic products that originate from the EU or that are imported
from third countries can use the EU logo on a voluntary basis.
All EU citizens, registered at an institution of higher education for art or
design based in the EU, are encouraged to enter this unique, international
design competition. Three winners will be selected, and the first prize winner
will be awarded a cash prize of € 6,000. The first and second runners-up
will receive € 3,500 and € 2,500 respectively. Entries can be
uploaded onto the special competition website www.ec.europa.eu/organic-logo
until 25 June, 2009. 
The EU Organic Logo Competition will be judged by a jury of experts from the
field of organic farming and production, and internationally renowned design
professionals. Prominent jury members include Professor, Honorary Doctor,
Creative Director &amp; Managing Partner Erik Spiekermann from Germany;
Riitta Brusila-Räsänen, Professor of Graphic Design from the
University of Lapland / Finland; Szymon Skrzypczak, a prize-winning young
designer from Poland; Elisabeth Mercier, Director of Agence BIO from
France; Urs Niggli, Director of the Research Institute of Organic
Agriculture (FiBL) from Switzerland; Tom Václav&#237;k, a marketing
expert for organic products from the Czech Republic and President of the
International Organic Retailers Association; and Craig Sams, the Chair of
the Soil Association from the UK. The competition jury will be chaired by Rob
Vermeulen, former president of the Pan-European Brand Design
Association. 
After the entry deadline, the jury will select the best submissions which
will then be featured on the competition website as the official candidates for
the new logo. All European citizens will be invited to help choose the winning
logo by voting for their favourite online. In the summer of 2010, the winner and
two runners-up will be invited to the awards ceremony in Brussels, where the
European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development will present them
with their prizes. 
The competition challenges students to design an eye-catching, original logo
that captures the diverse aspects of organic farming and production.
Additionally, the jury will assess the designs according to their universal
appeal, their comprehensibility without the use of words, their clarity of
presentation and their timelessness. Full terms and conditions can be found on
the website www.ec.europa.eu/organic-logo.
