Brussels, 5 February 2009'For Diversity. Against Discrimination.':
this year's EU award-winning articlesThe EU's 'For Diversity. Against Discrimination'
prize for journalists has been awarded today to a French article about gay
football players, in a tie with a Danish article about women who convert to
Islam. The third prize went to a Portuguese article while the special Roma Award
has been won by a Greek journalist. The award ceremony will take place in Prague
this evening at the Kaiserstejnsky Palace.
"Media play a key role in the fight against discrimination, prejudices and
stereotypes," says Vladimír &#352;pidla, EU Commissioner for Equal
Opportunities. "The values of diversity and social cohesion are all the more
important in the current social, economic and financial context."
At today's ceremony, the European Commission will honour those journalists
who, through their writing, help foster a better understanding of the benefits
of diversity and who encourage readers to consider more closely issues of
discrimination and inequality. This year, the Commission is dedicating a Special
Award to an article concentrating on Roma issues.
Pascale Krémer, journalist at Le Monde, wins the joint first
prize with her article “Homophobie et football: la leçon de
Chooz” (Homophobia and football – The lesson of Chooz) on gay
players in a local football team. It looks at how the lucrative marketing world
of football helps perpetuate discrimination against gays and lesbians but also
examines the positive measures taken by football leagues across Europe to combat
it.
The other joint first prize goes to Ole Hall, journalist at the Danish
Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten. His article “Danske muslimer udsat
for chikane” (Danish Muslims are subject to harassment) reveals how
Danish women who convert to Islam suddenly go from being a member of a majority
to becoming a very visible minority in their home country. As such, they face
the same prejudices and hostility from society as Muslims of foreign parentage.Christiana Martins and Marisa Antunes win the third place with their article
“Elite à prova de racismo” (Racism-proof elite) about
successful Portuguese citizens from minority backgrounds who have broken through
glass ceilings. It was published in the weekly Portuguese newspaper
Expresso.
For the Special Roma award, Mika Kontourousi, journalist at the Eleftheros
Tipos wrote the article “Η
&#915;ι&#959;υ&#950;γι&#940;ν
&#963;π&#940;ει τα &#963;ύν&#959;ρα
τη&#962; φυ&#955;ή&#962; τη&#962;”
(Yuzyan “breaks” the borders of her tribe). It describes the
problems Roma women are confronted with when they try to move away from their
traditional roles in society.
The prize-giving ceremony will take place as part of a seminar on 'Media for
Diversity', organised by the European Commission. The seminar will present the
results of a pan-European study on good practices by and about the media in
tackling discrimination and promoting diversity. It will gather more than 80
media professionals, equality bodies and NGOs from around Europe.  
The Journalist Award scheme is one of a wide range of awareness-raising
activities taking place as part of the EU's 'For Diversity. Against
Discrimination.' information campaign. European Youth Press and the Association
of European Journalists are partners of this Award edition.
The winning entries to the journalist award scheme were selected from over
545 articles from all 27 Member States submitted between 1 January and
31 October 2008. The jury members underlined the high quality of the
articles submitted. The four European winners will each receive a grant for a
research trip to an EU country of their choice.
