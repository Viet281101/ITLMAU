Brussels, 29 January 200920 Member States still not in compliance
with Community legislation promoting energy
efficiencyToday, the Commission sent a Reasoned Opinion to
twenty Member States who have failed to communicate their transposition of the
Energy Services
Directive[1]. The
Directive aims at strengthening and improving energy end-use efficiency by
providing a framework for incentives and energy services.
Despite a letter of formal notice sent to Member States in question in July
2008, they have not yet informed the Commission of full transposition of the
Directive into national legislation. The Commission has therefore initiated the
second stage of the infringement procedure against Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus,
Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia,
Sweden and the United Kingdom.
The Directive establishes a framework within which Member States can create a
business climate and infrastructure for energy efficiency throughout the
economy. The Directive applies to buildings, transport, agriculture and industry
sectors. It also creates the conditions for the development and promotion of a
market for energy services and for the delivery of other energy efficiency
improvement measures by addressing the role of energy distributors, the
financing of energy savings, the exemplary role of the public sector and the
importance of the availability of information.
The commitment of Member States to energy efficiency at political level must
be endorsed by legal action on national level.

the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2005 on energy end-use
efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC
