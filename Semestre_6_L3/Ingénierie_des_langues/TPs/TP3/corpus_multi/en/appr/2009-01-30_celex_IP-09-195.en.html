Brussels, 30 January 2009Do you want to know what is coming up on the
EU's agenda?The European Commission has launched the EU
Calendar, a new Internet tool that allows people anywhere in the world to find
out what will be on the agenda of the European institutions in the near
future.
"The EU Calendar gives journalists in the Member States access to the same
information as the Brussels' press corps. The public can of course see it too. 
An excellent example of "going local", said Vice-President Margot
Wallstr√∂m, responsible for Institutional Relations and Communication
Strategy.
The EU Calendar is a web tool that aims to help journalists and information
professionals to find their way through the continuous flow of information
available on EU matters. It is a unique entry point for advance information
(texts, links and images) on upcoming legislation, actions and events prepared
or organised by the EU institutions. 
All the information is available within 3 mouse clicks:a calendar of upcoming actions and events (weekly, monthly, and
quarterly);
brief information on each event (place, date, contacts, summary of content
); 
images, video's and/or specific websites giving in depth
information.Have a look at the EU Calendar at: http://europa.eu/eucalendar/
