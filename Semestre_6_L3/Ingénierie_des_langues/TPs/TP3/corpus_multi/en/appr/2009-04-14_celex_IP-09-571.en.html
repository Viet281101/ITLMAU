Brussels, 14 April 2009Citizens' privacy must become priority in
digital age, says EU Commissioner RedingIn a video posted on her website this morning,
Viviane Reding, the European Union's Commissioner for Information Society and
Media, said that Europeans must have the right to control how their personal
information is used, and said that the Commission would take action wherever EU
Member States failed to ensure that new technologies such as behavioural
advertising, RFID 'smart chips' or online social networking respected this
right. 
"Europeans must have the right to control how their personal information
is used," said Viviane Reding, the EU's Commissioner for Information Society
and Media, announcing several areas in which the Commission is ready to act to
maintain this right as technology trends make it easier to use, and misuse,
personal information. She warned that the EU would take action where Member
States fail to implement EU rules ensuring privacy and the need for a person's
consent before processing his or her personal data.
"European privacy rules are crystal clear: a person's information can only
be used with their prior consent. We cannot give up this basic principle, and
have all our exchanges monitored, surveyed and stored in exchange for a promise
of 'more relevant' advertising! I will not shy away from taking action where an
EU country falls short of this duty," said Commissioner Reding in her video
message. 
Viviane Reding also warned that Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), the
smart chips integrated in products to send radio signals, would only realise
their economic potential "if they are used by the consumer and not
on the consumer. No European should carry a chip in one of their
possessions without being informed precisely what they are used for, with the
choice to remove or switch it off at any time." 
The Commissioner also called on social networking companies to reinforce
privacy protection online: "Privacy must in my view be a high priority for
social networking providers and their users. I firmly believe that at least the
profiles of minors must be private by default and unavailable to internet search
engines.Â The European Commission has already called on social networking
sites to deal with minors' profiles carefully, by means of self-regulation. I am
ready to follow this up with new rules if I have to."
Background
The EU Directive on privacy and electronic communications requires EU Member
States to ensure confidentiality of the communications by prohibiting unlawful
interception and surveillance unless the users concerned have given their
consent (Article 5(1) of Directive
2002/58/EC). The EU Data Protection Directive specifies that a person must
freely give specific consent and be informed before their personal information
is processed (Article 2(h) of Directive
95/46/EC). 
Last February the Commission brokered an agreement
between 17 major social networking companies to improve privacy, especially of
minors, on social networking websites (IP/09/232).
In this agreement companies recognised their responsibility to ensure child
safety and committed to enabling and encouraging users to employ a safe approach
to personal information and privacy. Later this month they will inform the
Commission about their individual safety policies and how they will put in place
the principles in the agreement.
