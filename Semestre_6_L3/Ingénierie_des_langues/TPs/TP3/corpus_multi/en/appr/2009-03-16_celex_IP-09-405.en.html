Brussels, 16 March 2009Towards an EU wide Master's in
translationThe creation of the European Master's in
Translation (EMT) network will be the central theme of an international
conference organised by the European Commission in Brussels on 16 and 17 March
2009, where over one hundred universities and other stakeholders involved in
translator training will come together to agree on the criteria for training
programmes to become part of a common EMT quality label. The European Commission
invites universities that train professional translators to join a European
network of high-quality training programmes.
"High-quality, attractive translator training curricula provided by
universities throughout the European Union contribute to a secure supply of
skilled professionals not only for the Commission and the EU institutions, but
for all translation markets" said Leonard Orban, the European Commissioner for
Multilingualism. 
The European Master's in Translation should become a quality benchmark for
translator training consisting of a set of competencies to be acquired in a
Master's degree in translation. The scheme was launched in 2005 at the
initiative of the Directorate-General for Translation of the European
Commission, and has been developed in close co-operation with recognised experts
on the translation profession from the academic world.
The first two conferences, organised in October 2006 and March 2008, laid the
basis for the cooperation by proposing a standard set of key competencies within
a translation study curriculum. The standard competencies can be introduced by
any university which provides translator training and wishes to participate in
the EMT network. The Commission gives advice, but the responsibility for
translator training rests exclusively with the universities. 
The establishment of the network will be the culmination of the four-year
development of the EMT scheme, initiated by the Commission's
Directorate-General for Translation. 
When it is set up, the network will help promote the exchange of best
practice between participating universities and, ultimately, enhance teaching
standards, the professionalism of future translators, and the creation of a
truly European market for skilled translators.
A recent announcement[1] by
the Commission about a potential shortage of translators in some languages
confirms the need for a steady supply of professionals from translator training
institutes.
The EMT conference 2009 focuses specifically on:key competencies required for future translators;
university training and employability in order to enhance cooperation
between universities in different countries;
the admission criteria for the EMT network;
the advantages and responsibilities of network members and applicants;
the future work and organisation of the network.Attendance at
the conference is by invitation only, but the event will be webcast live
