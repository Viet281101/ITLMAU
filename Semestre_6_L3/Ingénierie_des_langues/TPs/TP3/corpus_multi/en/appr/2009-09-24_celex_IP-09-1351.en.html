IP/09/1351 Brussels, 24 September 2009 Commission cuts red tape and improves investor protection on securities prospectuses (see  MEMO/09/412 ) In line with the "Better Regulation" principles, the European Commission has today put forward a proposal for the review of the Prospectus Directive. The proposal is part of simplification exercise within the Action Program of the European Commission for the Reduction of Administrative Burdens in the European Union. The proposal increases legal clarity and efficiency in the prospectus regime and reduces administrative burdens for issuers and intermediaries. It also bears in mind the importance of enhancing the level of investor protection and ensuring that the information provided is sufficient and adequate to cover the needs of retail investors. It reflects consultation with all major stakeholders. The proposal now passes to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for consideration. Internal Market and Services Commissioner Charlie McCreevy said: " These new rules meet the needs of issuers and investors and removes any unnecessary burdens on businesses. It takes account of the lessons learned from the financial crisis and will ensure that investors have all the information they need." The Prospectus Directive lays down the rules governing the prospectus that has tobe made available to the public in case a public offer or admission to trading of transferable securities in a regulated market takes place in the EU. One of its major achievements is the introduction of a "passport mechanism": the prospectus approved by the competent authority in one Member State is valid for public offers and admission to trading of securities in the entire EU. Despite the significant positive impact on the quality and appropriateness of information available to investors, this legal framework needed to be further refined in order to increase legal clarity and efficiency in the prospectus regime and reduce administrative burdens. The new rules will make securities issues more efficient by making the rules easier to understand (greater legal clarity); reducing administrative burdens for issuers and intermediaries; giving issuers' employees access to a full range of investment opportunities; and helping retail investors more effectively analyse the prospects and risks posed by a security before investing. The main changes proposed are as follows:    some types of securities issue will be subject to less comprehensive disclosure requirements (small companies, small lenders, rights issues and government guarantee schemes);    the format and content of the prospectus summary have been improved;    there are clearer exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus when companies sell through intermediaries (“retail cascades”) and for employee share schemes;    disclosure requirements that currently overlap with the Transparency Directive will be repealed;    issuers of all non-equity securities will be able to determine their home Member State;    the definition of 'qualified investors' in the  Prospectus Directive  will be aligned with the one of 'professional clients' as defined in the D  irective on markets in financial instruments  .   About the Prospectus Directive The Prospectus Directive came into force on 31st December 2003 by its publication in the EU Official Journal. Member States were required to implement it in their jurisdictions no later than 1 July 2005. Article 31 of the Prospectus Directive required the European Commission to assess the application of the Directive five years after its entry into force and to present, where appropriate, proposals for its review. Moreover, in January 2007, the European Commission launched the Action Programme for reducing administrative burdens in the European Union to measure administrative costs arising from legislation in the EU and reduce administrative burdens by 25% by 2012. The Prospectus Directive has been identified as one area that contains a number of burdensome obligations for companies, some of which can be alleviated. At the same time, also in the light of the current financial crisis, it has been considered appropriate to review certain provisions of the Prospectus Directive in order to increase its efficiency as well as upgrade investor protection. To this effect and in line with the "Better Regulation" principles, the European Commission set up a public consultation process. This proposal and its impact assessment are the result of an extensive and continuous dialogue with all major stakeholders, including securities regulators, market participants (issuers, intermediaries and investors), and consumers. It takes due account of the observations and analysis contained in the reports published by the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and the European Securities Markets Expert Group (ESME).
