Brussels, 7 May 2009Telecoms: Commission acts on termination
rates to boost competitionThe European Commission has today set out clear
guidance for EU telecoms regulators on the cost-based method to be used when
calculating termination rates – the wholesale fees charged by operators to
connect the call from another operator's network which are part of everyone's
phone bill. The guidance is in the form of a "Recommendation" that national
regulators are obliged to take "the utmost account" of. The Recommendation
indicates specifically that termination rates at national level should be based
only on the real costs that an efficient operator incurs to establish the
connection. Eliminating price distortions between phone operators across the EU
will lower consumer prices for voice calls within and between Member States,
saving business and household customers at least €2 billion in 2009-2012,
and help investment and innovation in the entire telecoms sector. Mobile
termination rates varied widely in the EU in 2008 from 2.00 euro cents per
minute (in Cyprus) to 15 euro cents per minute (in Bulgaria). Mobile termination
rates (on average 8.55 euro cents per minute) are also typically 10 times higher
than fixed termination rates (on average ranging from 0.57 to 1.13 euro cents
per minute). Higher mobile termination rates make it harder for fixed and small
mobile operators to compete with large mobile operators. These divergences, and
differing regulatory approaches, undermine the Single Market and Europe's
competitiveness. 
"Despite efforts by some national regulators to bring termination rates
closer to their real costs, they remain very disparate across the EU, with large
gaps between fixed and mobile termination rates. This is not in line with the
increasing convergence between fixed and mobile telephony and can lead to
serious distortions of competition between Member States and operators,"
said Viviane Reding, EU Telecoms Commissioner. "The Commission decided to
intervene today against these distortions of competition in the Single Market,
which deter investment into upgrading fixed networks to fibre and for which in
the end consumers are paying the price." 
"Bringing down termination rates to an efficient level will increase
competition to the benefit of European consumers," said EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes: “Only a rigorous and harmonised approach to
regulation will ensure that the existing distortions of competition are removed
in the whole EU and that innovative new products combining fixed and mobile
calls will emerge. This is why today's Commission decision is a milestone in the
pro-competitive development of EU telecoms regulation. "
To realise the full potential of a single telecoms market, the Commission's
Recommendation sets out cost factors that all EU national telecoms regulators
should take account of when setting termination rates which are not market
prices, but regulated by national regulators. This will make termination rates
converge to a considerably lower level than today (to approximately 1.5 euro
cents to 3 euro cents per minute by the end of 2012, according to a Commission
Staff Working Paper that accompanies the Recommendation). Termination rates
should be based on the costs of an efficient operator and should apply to all
operators at the same level. Exceptions are allowed in certain conditions, for a
limited period of time, for cost differences outside an operator's control.
The Commission has identified inconsistencies across Europe in an assessment
of about 120 regulatory proposals from national telecoms regulators relating to
termination rates over the past 6 years. Mobile termination rates (on average of
8.55 euro cents per minute) are also around 10 times higher than fixed-line
termination rates (that range on average from 0.57 to1.13 euro cents per
minute). The French regulator, ARCEP,
estimates that efficient mobile termination rates would be between 1.00 euro
cents and 2.00 euro cents per minute. 
Indirect subsidy for mobile operators
For the Commission, these variations cannot be justified by differences in
underlying costs, networks or national characteristics. They are an indirect
subsidy that benefits mobile operators with a large market share to the
detriment of smaller and fixed-line operators. They also direct funds away from
critical investments like upgrades to high-speed internet networks, and hinder
innovative services like converged fixed-mobile products and
competitively-priced bundles of calls. 
Termination rates are both revenue and an expense for operators: when one
operator makes less revenue from them, another operator faces lower costs.
During the four-year period from 2009-2012, as regulators align with the more
consistent approach outlined in the Recommendation, smaller mobile operators
(who are net senders of call traffic to other networks) can expect to pay less
to their larger competitors, fixed operators could get at least €2 billion
of additional revenue by paying lower, cost-based termination rates for fixed to
mobile calls and consumers are expected to save at least €2 billion. The
longer-term impact will be even bigger as operators generate new revenues, as
new operators have the incentive to enter the market and grow and as consumers
benefit from lower prices and greater service innovation.
All EU national regulators should apply the recommended approach to
termination rates by the end of 2012. However, national regulators with limited
resources may use different approaches for a limited further period as long as
they achieve the same pro-competitive result.
Background
Today's Recommendation on the regulation of termination rates in the EU
follows a consultation of the public (June to September 2008 (IP/08/1016)
and of Member States (October 2008 to February 2009), and a 30-day scrutiny by
the European Parliament. 
Under Article 19 of the Framework Directive on the EU telecoms rules, the
Commission harmonises the application of EU telecoms rules in the Single Market
to promote competition and consumer benefits.

Call termination at local level: refers to the conveyance of calls
from the local exchange or switch located nearest to the called subscriber to
the premises of the called subscriber where the call is completed.
Call termination at single transit level: refers to the conveyance of
calls from a transit switch located at a higher network level through the local
exchange/switch for completion at the called subscriber's premises.
Call termination at double transit level: refers to the conveyance of
calls from a transit switch located at a higher network level through two
exchanges/switches for completion at the called subscriber's premises.
