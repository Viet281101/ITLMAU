Brussels, 18 February 2009116000 EU missing children hotline working
in five Member StatesTwo years ago, the European Commission reserved
116000 as a common missing children telephone hotline (IP/07/188)
for the entire EU and called on Member States to get it up and running. While
last year, the 116000 number was only working in Hungary (IP/08/1129),
after repeated calls from the Commission, all EU Member States have today made
the number publicly available to hotline providers. The number has also been
assigned to service providers in nine Member States, compared to seven last
year. 116000 is now a working service in five countries (Greece, Hungary, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Romania). It will also be functioning soon in two
further countries (Belgium and Slovakia). After having closely monitored that
116000 is reserved by EU countries, as required under EU law, the Commission now
calls once again on Member States to support and guide would-be 116000 hotline
operators so that parents and children can call 116000 when they need it,
everywhere in Europe.
"It is good news that the missing children hotline 116000 is now working
in Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal and Romania. However, I would have
expected a more ambitious approach from other Member States. There is no room or
time for complacency when it comes to the safety of our children," said
Viviane Reding, EU Telecoms Commissioner. "I am calling on Member States to
live up to their responsibilities and inform service providers of the
availability of the 116 numbers so we can quickly get the hotlines running
across the EU. Beyond legal obligations – which I will continue to enforce
vigorously – there is a moral obligation to European parents and
children."
Today, the 116 000 EU missing child hotline works in five EU Member
States (Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, Portugal and Romania). In these
countries, the number has been assigned to service providers who must be able to
handle calls appropriately, free of charge, 24/7, nation-wide. In Hungary, since
the introduction of 116000, there have been about 40,000 attempted calls each
month, of which the Hungarian hotline, Kék Vonal can answer about 6-7 thousand
monthly.
Last year, 116000 proved its added value in a cross-border parental abduction
case. In Belgium, a father took his daughters aged seven, ten and fourteen, and
hid them for nine and a half months, in very poor and dangerous conditions. In
September 2008, following a request from the Belgian and Portuguese 116000 missing children hotlines,
the evening news on Portuguese TV channel RTP-TV opened with an appeal for
information about these missing children and concluded by showing 116000
full-screen. Minutes after the broadcast, the case was resolved. Implementing
116000 everywhere in Europe would make search campaigns and international
cooperation easier and more effective. Hotlines would be able to act in a more
coordinated way to resolve cross-border disappearances of children.The implementation of the two other numbers, 116111 (helplines for
children to call for assistance) and 116123 (emotional support lines),
reserved in October 2007, is also progressing well. 
Sixteen Member States (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark,
Estonia, Greece, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, The Netherlands, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Sweden and Slovakia) have assigned 116111, compared to
ten last year. Number assignment is ongoing in two countries (Cyprus and Spain).
While last year it worked only in Hungary, 116111 is now operational in nine
Member States (Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia) and will soon be functioning in five other
countries (Greece, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Sweden). 
116123, the emotional support hotline, has been assigned to
helpline operators in seven Member States (Austria, Germany, Finland,
Ireland, The Netherlands, Sweden, Slovenia). Number assignment is ongoing in
Cyprus. 116123 works in Austria and will soon be in place in three other
countries (Germany, Sweden, and Slovenia).
Last July, a progress report from the Commission showed that Member States so
far made few efforts to inform potential service providers about the 116
numbers, and called on them to do more (IP/08/1129).
In particular, Member States can step up their efforts by providing potential
service providers, who usually know little about telecoms matters, with guidance
on how to be assigned a number, and give them a single point of contact within a
Ministry or a national regulatory authority.Background
In July 2006, the European Commission proposed to reserve a common telephone
number to report missing children (116000) and another for children to call when
they need help (116111). This follows the adoption of the EU strategy on the
rights of the child (IP/06/927).
On 15 February 2007 and 30 October 2007 respectively the Commission decided to
reserve 116000 (IP/07/188)
and 116111 in all Member States. The decision obliges EU countries to make "116
numbers" publicly available, but does not oblige them to assign the numbers to a
service provider or ensure provision of the services.Further information on 116:
