Brussels, 28th January 2009Better regulation – a European success
storyThe strategic review on Better Regulation in the
European Union tabled by the European Commission today, shows that better
regulation is a core component of Europe's response to the economic and
financial crisis.  The review shows that citizens and companies, in particular
small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), already benefit from simplified
measures and administrative costs savings. Thanks to radical simplification some
1,300 acts, representing around 10 % of the acquis or 7800 pages of
the Official Journal, have been proposed for removal so far.  The administrative
burden reduction measures already presented or foreseen, represent savings in
excess of €30billions. Today's proposal on VAT alone amounts to €18
billion in savings. The Commission's leadership on administrative burdens has
inspired most Member States and 21 of them have put in place at national level
ambitious national programmes to reduce administrative burdens. Finally the
Commission will continue to improve the quality of all new legislation it
produces by further upgrading the quality of its impact assessments. It will do
this by strengthening the subsidiarity check, improving the consultation of
stakeholders, and by assessing more thoroughly impacts on, for example, SMEs,
administrative burdens, fundamental rights, consumers and regions. 
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso said, "The
reduction of administrative burden proposed by the Commission is an essential
part of the European recovery initiative. Times are changing. Regulation must be
dynamic not static. It must adapt to new situations and new needs. By improving
consultation of stakeholders, through better impact assessments and cutting
administrative burdens we can make European regulation ever more effective and
user-friendly. The Commission is delivering. I hope that in the coming months
Member States and the European Parliament will maintain the momentum to our
efforts and deliver as well".
Vice President Günter Verheugen stated “Four years after its
launch the Better Regulation strategy is a success. We have already achieved
impressive results and are keen to go much further by the end of this year.
Better Regulation – regulating where necessary but keeping burdens on
businesses and citizens to the minimum necessary - must remain an essential part
of our response to current economic difficulties.” 
Radical simplification of EU law
continued in 2008
By simplifying and codifying legislation, this Commission has taken action
which once all agreed by Council and Parliament will reduce the acquis of EU
legislation by almost 10% - about 1,300 legal acts and 7,800 pages of the
Official Journal. 
However there is room for further simplification, and the Commission will
deliver on 33 new initiatives in 2009. Following a screening of the EU
legislation, further 81 actions could be incorporated in future simplification
activities.   As a result the next Commission should be able to complete on the
simplification exercise.

Cutting administrative burden under full speed
Since the presentation of the European Commission proposal  to  reduce
administrative burdens on businesses in the EU by 25% in 2012 and to engage also
Member States, the number of Member States which have set similar national
reduction targets increased significantly from 7 (2006), to 14 (2007) and 21
(2008). 
In 2007 and 2008 the Commission has tabled 21 Fast Track Actions (FTA)
representing estimated savings of more than € 2.3 billion for EU
businesses. In addition the foundations were laid to allow for Commission
proposals, implying large scale cost reductions. Today the Commission has
adopted a proposal for an ambitious revision of the VAT Directive to
remove the barriers to electronic invoicing. The yearly reduction potential
could be as high as € 18 billion in the mid-term. In the case of company
law, the Commission plans to propose to allow Member States to exclude
micro-enterprises from the scope of EU accounting directives, which could bring
additional savings of € 7 billion. The “think small first
principle” is being applied across the board to these directives to tailor
the system to the needs of SMEs.
