Brussels, 5 May 2009Road to recovery: Cohesion Policy will help
Europe to get out of the crisis, say Commissioners Hübner and ŠpidlaCommissioners Danuta Hübner (Regional Policy)
and Vladimír Špidla (Employment, Social Affairs, and Equal
Opportunities) today welcomed the finalisation of an agreement by the Council
and European Parliament  in support of the   Cohesion Policy
package in response to the economic crisis.  The comprehensive package includes
a battery of measures, ranging from a massive cash injection in the form of
additional advance payments from the Structural Funds to fast-track procedures
to accelerate project implementation and the possibility for the  EU to
co-finance energy-efficiency improvements in housing. Member States have already
received an additional €6.25 billion in advance payments - €4.5 bn
from the European Regional Development Fund was paid out in mid-April, with a
further €1.5 bn from the European Social Fund (ESF) soon after.Commenting on these decisions, Commissioner Hübner said: "The
Cohesion Policy is helping Europe to get out of this crisis. Excellent
cooperation between the European Commission, the Member States, the European
Parliament, the EU Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social
Committee, has enabled us to  act quickly and decisively. We now urge the Member
States and regions to fully exploit all the possibilities offered by the
European Cohesion Policy and to select good quality projects to benefit from EU
support. We expect important spill-over effects from these measures for the
economy, particularly in the construction sector."
 Commissioner Špidla added: “At European level, our
first priority in this crisis is people – keeping people in jobs and
getting those who have lost their jobs back into work as quickly as possible.
The European Social Fund is helping thousands of Europeans build their skills
and retrain, improving their job opportunities. This agreement means it can make
an even bigger contribution to helping people who've lost their jobs or risk
losing them in the crisis. And it will allow smaller organisations to better
support the most vulnerable, in an easier manner."
Giving Member States and regions a head start
At the end of 2008, the Commission proposed a series of changes to the
regulations that govern the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the
European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund. The European Parliament gave
its green light to the legislative changes on 2 April. Today, Member States'
Ministers, meeting in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN), also
approved the measures, which will take effect by the end of May.
The aim of the €6.25 billion cash injection in the 27 Member States
is to stimulate project implementation and help protect and create new
jobs. The additional advances bring the total of pre-payments to nearly
€30 billion since 2007 (see the allocations by Member State in annex),
which represents almost 9% of the total €347 billion Cohesion
Policy budget for 2007-2013.The package comprises the following other
changes:Possibility for immediate funding for “major
projects” (those where total cost per project exceeds €50
million, or €25 million in the case of environment projects) without the
need for prior approval by the European Commission. Around 900 major projects
should be implemented between 2007 and 2013 throughout Europe, representing a
total investment of €120 billion (from the ERDF and the Cohesion
Fund).
Simplification of the system for advances paid to beneficiaries under
State-aid schemes. In practice, this means that State-aid advances paid to
beneficiaries may now reach 100% of the amount considered.
Simplification of the reimbursement system to reduce the
administrative burden on beneficiaries and to speed-up payments. The Commission
will now be able to reimburse basic overhead costs on a flat-rate basis or make
lump-sum payments for small projects, for example supporting vulnerable groups.Facilitate management of financial
engineering schemes (ERDF/ESF) combining grants and loans. JEREMIE
(Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises) enables small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), badly hit by the economic downturn, to access finance
more easily. The European Investment Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development can help in the preparation of major projects
through JASPERS (Joint Assistance in Supporting Projects in European Regions).
Specific support will also be given to non-bank micro-credit providers, through
the JASMINE initiative (Joint Action to support microfinance institutions in
Europe).
Possibility offered to all Member States to use ERDF funds (up to 4% of
their allocation) for energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy
measures in housing. This means the EU can co-finance national or regional
schemes to promote the installation of double glazing, wall insulation or solar
panels. Previous legislation gave only new Member States limited possibilities
to use support from the ERDF for housing.In December, a further
amendment was already agreed, stipulating that rules governing
"revenue-generating projects" such as toll motorways should only be applied for
ERDF and Cohesion Fund projects where total costs exceed
€1 million.
