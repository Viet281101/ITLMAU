Brussels, 27 April 2009A new era of EU youth policiesThe Commission has adopted a new EU strategy for
youth policy for the coming decade. Entitled "Youth – Investing and
Empowering", the new strategy acknowledges the fact that (1) young people are
one of the most vulnerable groups in society, especially in the current economic
and financial crisis, and (2) in our ageing society, young people are a precious
resource. The new strategy is cross-sectoral, with both short and long-term
actions, which involve key policy areas that affect Europe's young people,
particularly youth education, employment, creativity and entrepreneurship,
social inclusion, health and sport, civic participation, and volunteering. The
new strategy also emphasises the importance of youth work and defines reinforced
measures for a better implementation of youth policies at the EU
level.
The young generation is a dwindling resource, whose present share of 20% of
the population is projected to fall to 15% by 2050. Our youth are also a
precious resource, and the current economic and financial crisis especially
highlights the need to nurture young human capital. While young people in the EU
today enjoy greater opportunities, they also face difficult challenges, as many
drop out of school and employment, or are threatened by poverty and social
exclusion. 
According to surveys, education, employment, social inclusion and health are
issues which most of all preoccupy today's young people.  Europe's youth must
also be empowered to benefit from opportunities such as civic and political
participation, volunteering, creativity and entrepreneurship, sport and global
engagement. To confront such challenges, and open up opportunities for all young
people, the Commission is proposing a renewed EU youth strategy that sets out a
wide-ranging response.
The strategy "Youth – Investing and Empowering", which is a follow-up
to the renewed social agenda announced by the European Commission in 2008, has
the following goals:to create more opportunities for youth in education and employment, 
to improve access and full participation of all young people in society, andto foster solidarity between youth and society. It emphasises
the important role of youth work in dealing with unemployment, school failure
and social exclusion, as well as improving skills and providing leisure
time.
The Commission proposes to employ a cross-sectoral approach to address all
youth related issues, with the new strategy outlining different actions to be
pursued by the Commission and the Member States. As such, it constitutes a part
of the EU's coordinated response to the current crisis.
The strategy proposes a better, more flexible and simplified method of
coordinating youth policy among the Member States, with reinforced links with
the Lisbon Strategy for more growth and jobs.
Commenting on the new EU strategy for youth, the European Commissioner for
Education, Training, Culture and Youth, Jan Figel' said: "Youth is our
present and our future – and we must make a concerted effort to open up as
many avenues as possible for our young citizens, especially in the light of the
current economic and financial crisis. The key is to empower our youth to deal
with the many challenges they encounter in today's globalized world. Our new
strategy is a timely response to these challenges, which opens the door to a new
era in the development of youth policies at EU level." 
The Commission's adoption of the new strategy on youth follows an extensive
consultation exercise undertaken in 2008, involving national authorities, the
European Youth Forum, youth organizations and other stakeholders. Young people
themselves were consulted on-line and will now be invited to react to the
Commission's proposals in a new phase of the permanent dialogue between the EU
and its youth.
Today also sees the publication of the Commission's first "EU Youth Report",
which includes detailed data and analysis compiled by EUROSTAT. These reports
will now be published every three years and will contribute to providing a
better knowledge base in the field of youth.
