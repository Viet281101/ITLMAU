Brussels, 6 May 2009European SME week to boost entrepreneurship
in difficult timesPromoting entrepreneurship and raising awareness
about business support are the main messages of the first European SME Week
launched in Brussels today. More than 1000 events will take place in 35
countries from 6 to 14 May. Today more than ever the contribution of European
entrepreneurs for preserving jobs and creating new ones needs to be recognised
and supported. The week will also allow entrepreneurs to discover the
information, advice, support and ideas available at European, national, regional
and local levels to help them develop their activities. 
European Commission Vice-President Günter Verheugen, responsible for
Enterprise and Industry, opened the SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) week
today: “This Commission together with the Member States has worked hard
to improve the conditions for small companies. If there is a way out of the
economic downturn, it is the SMEs’ creativity, flexibility and capacity to
find solutions. Together we have already achieved improvements. But we must go
further. We need more SMEs as they are the true drivers of growth and job
creation”.
The SME Week is one of the measures implementing the Small Business Act
(SBA), the first really comprehensive SME policy framework for the EU and its
Member States. Policies to promote SMEs have been considerably advanced by the
European Commission since it took office in 2004:To anchor "Think Small First" principle in the EU 
Cutting administrative burden: SMEs will benefit from simplified
measures and administrative costs savings with the Commission’s objective
to reduce administrative burdens on businesses by 25% in 2012 and to engage also
Member States (see IP/09/131).
Revised state
aids rules make it easier for SMEs to benefit from public funding for
training, research and development, environmental protection and other types of
aid. 
A new statute for a European Private Company will allow SMEs to start
up and operate according to the same company law provisions throughout
Europe.
To encourage new entrepreneurs and inspire those planning to set up a new
business, the Erasmus for Young
Entrepreneurs European exchange programme was launched at the beginning of
2009. The programme helps them to acquire relevant skills for managing an SME by
spending time working in another EU country with an experienced entrepreneur.New legislation has been proposed to address the problem of late
payment by public administrations and businesses (see IP/09/552)Member States should have the option to apply reduced Value Added Tax
rates for locally supplied services, including labour intensive services,
such as hairdressing, catering, and repair services.During the SME
week, events are taking place to inform, assist and connect existing and
potential entrepreneurs and also help them develop new ideas and benefit from
personalised information and support.
