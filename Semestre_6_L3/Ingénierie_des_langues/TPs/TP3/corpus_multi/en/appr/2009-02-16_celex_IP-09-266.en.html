Brussels, 16 February 2009EU Member States on course for analogue
terrestrial TV switch-offEurope is leading the world in switching from
analogue to digital television. The European Commission is driving a coordinated
approach to the freeing up and future use of the radio spectrum because it wants
to ensure that EU citizens can enjoy the benefits of digital television,
including a growing range of interactive TV services (such as high definition TV
or video on demand), available on multiple transmission platforms including
terrestrial, cable, satellite, TV on internet and mobile TV networks. For that
to happen, Member States are gradually closing down spectrum-hungry analogue
transmissions and moving to digital broadcasting. Overall, the switch-off of
analogue terrestrial TV transmission in Europe is well on track. Switch-off has
already been completed in five Member States (Germany, Finland, Luxembourg,
Sweden and the Netherlands) and by 2010 the process should be well advanced in
the whole EU. The 2012 EU target for switch-off is expected to be met by almost
all Member States. 
“Europeans are enjoying the benefits of digital TV in ever growing
numbers. Several EU Member States are clearly world leaders in the switch from
analogue terrestrial TV transmission to digital TV," said Viviane Reding, EU
Telecoms and Media Commissioner. "Europe's switchover is going according to
plan and well on track, especially when compared to other countries around the
world. I am confident that in the next two years more EU countries will join the
first group of switched countries in the digital era. This means that an
important amount of fresh spectrum will become available for new TV and wireless
services – if Europe makes the right decisions quickly. Coordinated
decisions on the use of the so-called digital dividend are key to Europe's swift
economic recovery." 
Digital broadcasting provides improved picture quality, better sound, better
mobile reception, more TV and radio channels as well as enhanced information
services (such as on screen programme guides). As digital broadcasting uses the
radio spectrum more efficiently, it will free up capacity for new uses, such as
high definition TV, mobile communications or wireless broadband in rural areas.
This should stimulate innovation and opportunities for growth in the telecoms
and media industries, while contributing to European efforts to stimulate the
economic recovery. The Commission is working on a common approach on how to use
the spectrum released by the digital switchover to achieve the greatest benefits
for the single market and its 500 million citizens.
Digital terrestrial TV transmissions have already been introduced in 21
Member States (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany,
Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Latvia,
Malta, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Slovenia, United Kingdom) and cover
parts of the national territory. Five more Member States (Cyprus, Ireland,
Poland, Portugal, and Slovakia) have announced that digital services will be
provided by 2010 at the latest. Romania has not yet outlined its plans.
Analogue terrestrial TV switch-off has already taken place in Luxemburg, the
Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Belgium (Flanders) and in major areas in
Austria. It will take place by end of 2010 or earlier in all of Austria,
Estonia, Denmark, Spain, Malta and Slovenia. Analogue terrestrial TV will be
switched off between the end of 2010 and the end of 2012 in Belgium (Wallonia
and Brussels capital region), Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece, France,
Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and the United
Kingdom. In Poland the final switch-off date is 2015 at the latest.GroupMember StatesA (switch off completed)BE (Flanders), DE, FI, LU, NL, SEB (switch-off date end 2010 or earlier)AT, DK, EE, ES, MT, SIC (switch-off date: end 2012 or earlier)BE (Brussels capital area), BG, CY, CZ, EL, FR, HU,

planned for July 2011, South Korea for end 2012, Australia for 2013, India and
Russia for 2015. 
The technology used for digital terrestrial TV transmission in Europe is
DVB-T. The European Commission encourages the use of standards from the
DVB-family in the EU and worldwide (IP/08/451).
