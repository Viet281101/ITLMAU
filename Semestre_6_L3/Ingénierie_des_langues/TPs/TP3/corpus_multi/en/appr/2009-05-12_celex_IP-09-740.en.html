Brussels, 12 May 2009Small chips with big potential: New EU
recommendations make sure 21st century bar codes
respect privacyEuropeans should be able to have control over smart
chips, a worldwide market set to grow five times over in the next decade, while
still being able to easily use them to make everyday life simpler. There are
already over 6 billion smart chips, microelectronic devices that can be
integrated into a variety of everyday objects from fridges to bus passes. With
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, they can process data
automatically when brought close to 'readers' that activate them, pick up their
radio signal and exchange data with them. They are in the passes you use to
enter your office and the smart cards that pay highway tolls. Today, the
European Commission adopted a set of recommendations to make sure that everyone
involved in the design or operation of technology using smart chips respects the
individual's fundamental right to privacy and data protection, contained in the
Charter
of Fundamental Rights of the European Union proclaimed on 14 December
2007.
"A promising technology for the future, smart chips can make life simpler
in all sorts of ways. We are talking about everyday objects suddenly becoming
smart by connecting to a network and exchanging information. Think of
smart-fridges that inform you your milk is past its use-by date or smart-food
packaging warning parents about possible allergies," said Viviane Reding, EU
Commissioner for Information Society and Media. "There is clear economic
potential in using small, smart chips to allow communication between objects.
But Europeans must never be taken unawares by the new technology. This is why
the Commission issued strong recommendations to the industry today. European
consumers must be confident that if and when their personal data is involved,
their privacy will be impregnable also in a changing technological environment.
The Commission therefore wants RFID technology to empower consumers to control
their data security, which is the best way to make sure it is an economic
success. After all, the European share of the global smart chips market will
reach 35% in the next eight years."
Smart chips, or radio tags, can, and already do, have a huge impact on
business tasks, public services and consumer products, from more efficient
recycling and healthcare to less time spent at toll booths and waiting for
luggage at the airport. To make sure Europe is ready for these changes, the
Commission today laid out the following principles for protecting privacy and
data protection in their use:Consumers should be in control whether products they buy in shops use smart
chips or not. When consumers buy products with smart chips, these should be
deactivated automatically, immediately and free-of-charge at the point of sale,
unless the consumer explicitly opts-in by asking to keep the chip operational.
Exceptions can be granted to avoid unnecessary burden on retailers, for example,
but only after an assessment of the chip's impact on privacy.
Companies or public authorities using smart chips should give consumers
clear and simple information so that they understand if their personal data will
be used, the type of collected data (such as name, address or date of birth) and
for what purpose. They should also provide clear labelling to identify the
devices that 'read' the information stored in smart chips, and provide a contact
point for citizens to obtain more information.
Retail associations and organisations should promote consumer awareness on
products containing smart chips through a common European sign to indicate
whenever a smart chip is used by a product.
Companies and public authorities should conduct privacy and data protection
impact assessments before using smart chips. These assessments, reviewed by
national data protection authorities, should ensure that personal data is secure
and well protected.2.2 billion RFID tags, such as the ones used at
toll booths or to identify shipping containers, were sold worldwide in 2008,
roughly a third of these in Europe. The worldwide market value for RFID tags is
estimated to be of €4 billion in 2008 and to grow to about €20
billion by 2018.
Background:
In 2006, the European Commission launched a public consultation (IP/06/289)
on the development and use of smart chips (or Radio Frequency Identification
technologies). Based on this, it then adopted a Communication in March 2007 (IP/07/332)
showing that further action was expected by the public in terms of privacy and
data protection. Today's Recommendation, which was elaborated by consulting all
stakeholders from both the supplying and using industries, standardisation
bodies, consumers' organisations, civil society groups, and trade unions,
responds to these expectations and seeks to create a level-playing field for the
European industry while respecting individual's privacy. Member States now have
two years to inform the Commission on the steps they intend to take to make sure
that the objectives of the Recommendation are met. Within three years, the
Commission will report on the Recommendation's implementation, including an
analysis of its impact on companies and public authorities using smart chips as
well as its impact on citizens.
