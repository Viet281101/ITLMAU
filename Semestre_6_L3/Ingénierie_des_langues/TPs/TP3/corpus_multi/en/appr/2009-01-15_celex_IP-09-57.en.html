Brussels, 15 January 2009Dairy market: Commission proposes additional
measures to help dairy sectorFollowing the recent slump in prices for milk and
dairy products, Agriculture Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel today pledged to
introduce new measures to support the market. The Commission will next week
reintroduce export refunds for butter, cheese and whole and skimmed milk powder.
When intervention buying for butter and SMP begins in March, the Commission
undertakes to, if necessary, buy more than the pre-determined quantities through
regular tenders. In November, the Commission reintroduced private storage for
butter with effect from 1 January 2009 - including for butter produced in
December. This represented an introduction of private storage earlier than is
usually the case. 
"The severity of the fall in milk prices over recent months has surprised
many," said Commissioner Fischer Boel. "I have spoken to many producers during
my travels to different Member States and their anxiety is clear. Now it is time
for the European Union to help. Measures introduced in the Health Check will
give the dairy sector an important boost, but we need to do something now
because the Health Check will only apply from next season. I truly believe the
measures I am proposing today will go a long way to stabilising the dairy
market." 
Following the unprecedented price rise for milk and dairy products in 2007
and the beginning of 2008, the situation on the dairy market has now been
completely reversed. With increased supplies on the world market and reduced
demand on the internal market, market prices for dairy products have been forced
down to close to or even below intervention levels. Obviously, the price paid to
milk producers follows the same route with substantial price decreases already
recorded and with further falls likely. 
As regards intervention, buying of butter and skimmed milk powder will resume
on 1 March (with production from February being eligible) and remains available
until the end of August. The first 30,000 tonnes of butter and 109,000 tonnes of
skimmed milk powder will be bought in at a pre-determined price (intervention
price). We expect that this quantity of butter will be taken quite quickly and
consequently it will be necessary to support the market beyond this limit. As
was decided in the Health Check, further quantities may be accepted with prices
to be fixed through fortnightly tenders. Commissioner Fischer Boel has asked the
services to prepare for a decision to be presented to the Management Committee
to open up this facility, should the 30,000t limit on butter or the 109,000t
limit on skimmed milk powder be reached, in order to avoid any suspension of
intervention during this period of depressed prices.
As regards export refunds, it is now time to reactivate this instrument. A
sustained period of high prices on the world market led us to suspend export
refunds ever since June 2007. With world market prices now below EU intervention
and market prices, our exporters are no longer able to compete. This situation
is aggravated by the already existing difficulties for our exporters as a result
of the financial/credit crisis. Export refunds will be activated not only for
butter and skimmed milk powder but also for all other dairy products which were
eligible in the past, mainly whole milk powder and cheese. Refunds for butter
and skimmed milk powder are fixed by tender with the next round of bids to be
decided on next week. The frequency of the tenders will be increased from
once to twice a month in order to improve the efficiency of the system.
As in the past, the use of export refunds will be applied in conformity with
our rights and obligations under the WTO. As to the specific level of refunds,
this will depend on the offers we receive from the trade and will be judged
according to the usual objective criteria in order to ensure that refunds are
only given to the extent necessary.
With these measures, the Commission intends to send a clear signal to milk
producers and the dairy industry that the Commission stands ready to make full
use of our available instruments to support the market and the producers'
income.
