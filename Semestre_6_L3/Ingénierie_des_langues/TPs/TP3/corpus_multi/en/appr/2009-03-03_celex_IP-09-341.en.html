Brussels, 3 March 2009EU launches campaign to tackle gender pay
gapThe European Commission has today launched an
EU-wide campaign to help tackle the gender pay gap. Across the EU economy, women
earn on average 17.4% less than men. The simple concept of 'equal pay for work
of equal value' is at the heart of the campaign being launched in the context of
International Women's Day on 8 March to raise awareness of the pay gap, its
causes, and how to tackle it.
"The gender pay gap has multiple causes and needs multiple solutions.
Tackling it requires action at all levels and a commitment from everyone
concerned, from employers and trade unions to national authorities and every
citizen. Our campaign will make people more aware of why women in Europe still
earn so much less than men and what we can do about it," said EU Equal
Opportunities Commissioner Vladimír&#160;Špidla. "In today’s
economic climate, equality between women and men is more important than ever.
Only by reaping the potential of all our talents can we face up to the crisis,"
he added.
Equal pay for equal work is one of the European Union’s founding
principles. Enshrined in the Treaty of Rome in 1957, it was already the subject
of a 1975 directive which prohibits all discrimination in all aspects of pay
between women and men for the same work or for work of equal value. As a result,
"simple and visible" cases of direct discrimination – differences in pay
when a man and a woman are doing exactly the same job, with the same experience
and skills, and same performance – have fallen a lot thanks to the
effectiveness of European and national legislation on equal pay. But why then is
there still a gender pay gap of 17.4% across the EU?
The gender pay gap represents the difference between average hourly pay for
women and men before tax across the economy as a whole. It reflects ongoing
discrimination and inequality in the labour market which, in practice, mainly
affects women. For example, women's work is still often seen as less valuable
than the work that men do and women often work in sectors where wages are, on
average lower than those dominated by men, for example in a supermarket female
cashiers usually earn less than the store men.
The pay gap also reduces women's lifetime earnings and pensions causing
poverty in later life. 21% of women aged 65 and over are at risk of poverty
compared to 16% of men.
The campaign aims to raise awareness of the pay gap and how it can be
tackled. To reach out to citizens, employers and workers, the campaign will
promote good practices on the pay gap from around Europe and distribute a
campaign toolbox for employers and trade unions at European and at national
level. Other activities include the campaign website, advertising in European
press and a poster campaign.
It comes as a follow-up to the Commission's 2007 policy communication on the
pay gap, which analysed the causes of the gap and identified courses of action
at EU level. The Communication underlined the need to raise awareness of the pay
gap and how it can be tackled by acting at all levels, involving all
stakeholders and focusing on all contributing factors.
Annual report on equality
The 2009 report on equality between women and men – also presented by
the European Commission today – confirms that despite some progress on
gender equality, significant gaps still remain in several areas. While the
employment rate of women has been steadily rising over the last years (now 58.3%
for women against 72.5% for men), women still work part-time more often than men
(31.2% for women and 7.7% for men) and they predominate in sectors where wages
are lower (more than 40% of women work in health, education and public
administration – twice as many as men). However, women represent 59% of
all new university graduates.
Women and men in decision-making
Meanwhile, a new expert report prepared for the Commission confirms that
women are also highly under-represented in economic decision-making and in
European politics. The central banks of all 27 EU Member States are led by a
male governor. The under-representation of women at the top level is heightened
in big business where men account for nearly 90% of the board members in leading
companies (constituents of the blue-chip index in each country) - a figure which
has barely improved in recent years.
The proportion of women members of national parliaments (single/lower house)
has risen by around half over the last decade, from 16% in 1997 to 24% in 2008.
The European Parliament is just above this figure (31% women). On average, men
outnumber women among ministers in national governments by around three to one
(25% women, 75% men).
