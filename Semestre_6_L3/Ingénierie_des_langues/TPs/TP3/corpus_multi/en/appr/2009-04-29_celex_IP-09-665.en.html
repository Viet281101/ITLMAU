Brussels, 29 April 2009Modernisation of EU research funding on the
right trackToday, the European Commission presented a progress
report covering the first two years of the
7thEU framework programme for R&amp;D
(FP7), which will last until 2013.  The biggest EU R&amp;D funding programme
ever, with a €54bn budget over 7 years, proves to be well suited to answer
the EU's economic and societal needs. Its structure and new instruments help the
EU to address its challenges. Priority areas such as environment, energy or
nanotechnologies contribute to building a sustainable, low carbon economy, with
industry-led technology platforms helping to define topics which meet industry's
long term needs; the European Research Council supports our best researchers to
globally compete on scientific excellence. Joint Technology Initiatives embody
new public–private ventures on an unprecedented technological and
financial scale. FP7 is a strong asset in the EU's fight against the current
crisis with its budget growing every year by 13% until 2013. The report
underlines remaining challenges for the FP7 such as the mobilisation of new
Member States, the participation of SMEs and administrative
simplification.
The European Commissioner for Science and Research, Janez Potočnik,
said: "The economic crisis is a good reality check for our programmes. I'm
happy to see that FP7 is passing the test: it injects fresh money to support
research, with almost a doubling of the annual budget between 2007 and 2013, and
acts as an incentive for Member States and the industry to do likewise. FP7 is
one of the EU's key instruments to prepare for recovery from the crisis and to
come out of it greener and smarter."
Unfettered demand for EU funding and a successful launch of new R&amp;D
instruments
In its first two years, with around 25,000 proposals reaching the final
evaluation stage, 5,500 were selected to receive grants totalling around
€10 billion. Demand was high for the new European Research Council, with
around 11,000 proposals for its first calls. Over 600 grants have been provided
to excellent EU researchers. Responding to the needs of industry for strategic
technology development, five Public-Private Partnerships (JITS) have been
launched.  The new Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF), managed together with
the EIB, has approved loans of €2 billion to support high risk R&amp;D
projects.  
Realising the European Research Area
The FP7 overall objective is to build the Single Market for research and
support open innovation. It supports transnational cooperation, promotes "brain
circulation" through mobility grants and improves EU research and innovation
capacities by supporting research infrastructures. The programme supporting
collaborative research has attracted more than a third (36,7%) of all submitted
proposals, followed by the scheme for mobility of researchers (23,5%).      
Boosting sustainable development and the economy  
In the first two years, 44% of the budget for collaborative research has been
allocated to interdisciplinary research such as environment, energy,
agriculture, transport, nanotechnologies, ICT, supporting the EU's renewed
sustainable development strategy.  As part of the EU economic recovery plan, FP7
will support   the "greening" of the EU automotive, manufacturing and
construction sectors through three public-private R&amp;D partnerships.
Opening EU research to the world
Stronger and more strategic international cooperation is among the FP7
priorities. For instance, new countries have been associated to FP7, bringing
their total number to 12; a specific EU-Africa Partnership on Science,
Information and Space has been signed; and the International scientific
collaboration was promoted by the launch of the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER). 
Cutting red tape
FP7 has made progress in cutting red tape, notably through a new Guarantee
Fund and a Unique Registration Facility. Two new Executive Agencies have been
set up to specialise in the efficient implementation of EU research programmes:
the Research Executive Agency (REA) and the European Research Council (ERC).
Audit processes have been improved and streamlined.  
The way ahead
Some issues need further attention, such as the rather low participation of
SMEs.   Successful participation of researchers from new Member States can be
improved. Progress on simplification and the effective operation of new
instruments may require changing the ground rules.  
To further improve FP7, the Commission will be seeking advice from an
independent expert group, which will undertake a FP7 Interim Evaluation by
autumn 2010. 
The Commission today also adopted a response to the ex-post evaluation of the
FP6, which provides further input to the interim evaluation exercise.
