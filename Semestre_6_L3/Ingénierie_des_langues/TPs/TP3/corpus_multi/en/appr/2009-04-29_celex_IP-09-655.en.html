Brussels, April 29 2009EU budget 2010 targets
recoveryThe Commission today adopted a €139bn
preliminary draft budget for 2010. Economic recovery is at the heart of next
year’s spending and the proposal channels the biggest share of funds (45%)
into growth and employment measures – a 3.2% rise on 2009 – to help
restore competitiveness across the Union. Funds for major programmes linked to
research and energy will increase by more than 12% and cash for cohesion policy
will grow too, with the EU-12 set to receive 52% of cohesion and Structural
Funds. All headings in the budget will see an increase, reaching a total of
€138.6bn in commitments (1.18% of GNI) and €122.3bn in payments
(1.04% of GNI). 
Presenting the proposal, Siim Kallas, Vice-President for Administrative
affairs, Audit and Anti-fraud and responsible for Financial Programming and
Budget said: "This budget targets measures to help avert an even sharper
downturn. €6bn will go into research and innovation while some 9 million
citizens will receive support through the European Social Fund.” He
added “2010 will also see the second phase of the EU budget’s
contribution to the recovery plan secured bringing the total of extra crisis
funds to more than €6bn for the period 2008-2010".
€62 billion for jobs, infrastructure, competitiveness
Channelling funds into projects to save and create jobs, help companies and
restore competitiveness will be the EU's top priority. Trans-European transport
and energy networks will receive 12.7% more funding compared to 2009
(€1.08bn) and  the Competitiveness and Innovation programme (CIP) will
grow by 3.3% (€0.5bn). 2010 will be the European Year for Combating
Poverty and Social Exclusion with a budget of nearly €20m and a range of
initiatives planned for all Member States. For its second year, the EU’s
flagship satellite navigation project Galileo will receive an additional 8% in
funding (€0.9bn). 
Top slice of cohesion funds to go to EU-12
As part of the €62bn set for jobs and competitiveness, €49bn will
go towards cohesion in the EU-27. The trend to phase-in funding for the Member
States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 (EU-12) is continuing. For the first
time ever, the EU-12 will receive the biggest share of the EU’s Cohesion
and Structural Funds (52%). Agricultural support for these regions will also
grow, making a real impact with the EU-12 now receiving nearly 20%, €11bn
in agricultural support. Thanks to the CAP, the single market and higher market
prices, farmers’ income in the EU-12 is now 47% higher than before
accession. Funding for natural resources in the EU-27 stands at €59bn and,
as part of this, spending for environment and rural development will grow by
nearly 2.5% to almost €15bn.
Second phase of financing for the European Economic Recovery Plan 
April 2009 saw the European Parliament, Council and Commission agree on the
need for a fresh €5bn to finance major European projects in the areas of
energy and broadband infrastructures and to face new challenges in rural areas
linked to the CAP health check. Following the first injection of €2.6bn in
2009, a further €2.4bn in will be added to the 2010 budget, the source of
the funds being decided later on in the 2010 budget procedure. 
 € 8 billion in external aid 
In 2010, the EU will continue its efforts to help poorer countries and
maintain a strong stance on the world stage so it can meet global challenges
like climate change, food security and globalisation. The EU's aid to developing
countries channelled through the Development Cooperation Instrument will
increase by 1.7%, reaching €2.4bn. Pre-accession assistance (IPA)
increases by nearly 5%, €1.6bn. Funding for the EU’s Common and
Foreign Security Policy (CSFP) will rise by 16% (to €282m). The last part
of the €1bn Food Aid Facility will also be financed in the 2010 budget
(€170m). 
Making the EU a safer place for all
The part of the budget to receive the biggest boost in spending (in line with
the EU’s seven-year financial programming) will be projects to fight
crime, terrorism and manage migration flows, increasing by 13.5% to almost
€1bn. 
More generally, administrative expenditure for all EU institutions will grow
moderately by 2.1%, with the European Commission's own expenditure increasing by
less than 1% (0.9%) at €3.6bn.
Background
The budget forecasts both commitments
(legal pledges to provide financing, provided that certain conditions are
fulfilled) and payments (actual cash or bank transfers to the
beneficiaries). The final adoption of the EU budget will take place during the
European Parliament plenary in December.
