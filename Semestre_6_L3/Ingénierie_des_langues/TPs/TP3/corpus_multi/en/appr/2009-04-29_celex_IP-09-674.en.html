Brussels, 29th April 2009Financial services sector pay: Commission
sets out principles on remuneration of risk-taking staff in financial
institutionsThe European Commission has adopted a
Recommendation on remuneration in the financial services sector. It recommends
that Member States should ensure that financial institutions have remuneration
policies for risk-taking staff that are consistent with and promote sound and
effective risk-management. The Recommendation sets out guidelines on the
structure of pay, on the process of design and implementation of remuneration
policies and on the role of supervisory authorities in the review of
remuneration policies of financial institutions. The Commission has also adopted
a Recommendation on directors' pay (see IP/09/673).
Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy said: â€œUp to now, there
have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services
industry. It is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage
excessive risk-taking for short term gain. The G20 agreed that the FSF's tough
new principles on compensation schemes should be implemented. The Commission is
leading the way. Incentives need to be aligned with long-term, firm-wide
profitability. Of course, remuneration levels should continue to be based on
performance. But performance criteria should be risk-adjusted and take into
account cost of capital and liquidity. Design and oversight of remuneration
policies should remain the responsibility of the board and not be delegated to
senior management. An increased role of supervisory authorities in the review of
remuneration practices is also needed to promote sound remuneration practices in
financial institutions".
The Recommendation invites Member States to adopt measures in four areas:Structure of pay: remuneration policies for risk-taking staff should
be consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management. For this
purpose, financial institutions should strike an appropriate balance between the
level of the core pay and the level of the bonus. The payment of the major part
of the bonus should be deferred in order to take into account risks linked to
the underlying performance through the business cycle. Performance measurement
criteria should privilege longer-term performance of financial institutions and
adjust the underlying performance for risk, cost of capital and liquidity.
Financial institutions should also be able to claim back already paid bonuses,
where data has been proven to be manifestly misstated (claw-back).
Governance: remuneration policy should be transparent internally,
should be clear and properly documented and contain measures to avoid conflicts
of interest. The board should have responsibility for oversight of the operation
of the remuneration policy for the financial institution as a whole with an
adequate involvement of internal control functions and human resources
departments or experts. Board members and other staff involved in the design and
operation of remuneration policies should be independent.
Disclosure: remuneration policy should be adequately disclosed to
stakeholders. The disclosure should be made in a clear and easily understandable
way and contain core elements of the remuneration policy, its design and
operation.
Supervision: supervisors should ensure, using the supervisory tools
at their disposal, that financial institutions apply the principles on sound
remuneration policies to the largest possible extent and have remuneration
policies consistent with effective risk management. In order to address the
question of proportionality, supervisors should take account of the nature and
scale of the financial institution and the complexity of its activities in order
to assess its compliance with the principles on sound remuneration
policies.The Recommendation takes due account of efforts already
made by several Member States and aims to foster these developments by
identifying best practices to ensure greater convergence in the EU. The
Recommendation covers all sectors of the financial services industry so as to
avoid loopholes and prevent distortions of competition between different sectors
and financial institutions. The principles apply to all categories of staff
whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the
financial institution. 
The Recommendation will be followed up by legislative proposals to bring
remuneration schemes within the scope of prudential oversight. In June, the
Commission will present proposals to revise the Capital Requirements Directive
to ensure that regulatory capital adequately covers the risks inherent in banks'
trading book, securitisation positions and remuneration policies.
After one year, the Commission will examine both Recommendations in the light
of the experience acquired and of the outcome of the monitoring and will submit
an evaluation report on Member States' application of both Recommendations.
