Brussels, 9 march 2009Cohesion Policy backs "green economy" for
growth and long-term jobs in EuropeDanuta Hübner, European Commissioner for
Regional Policy, announced today that €105 billion will be invested in the
"green economy" through the EU Cohesion Policy. The funding, which represents
more than 30% of the regional policy budget for 2007-2013, offers a solid
platform for job creation and a significant boost for regions and cities in
their quest to maintain Europe's global leadership in the field of green
technologies. 
Commissioner Hübner said: "Support for the green economy and the
environment goes hand-in-hand with the Cohesion Policy's objective to deliver
sustainable growth, jobs and competitiveness. In a difficult financial climate,
this investment will be instrumental in creating long-term employment and
reviving local economies, as well as underpinning the EU's commitment to the
fight against climate change."
Ambitious spending on environmental initiatives
The €105 billion dedicated to green projects and jobs is almost
three times greater than the sum allocated in the 2000-2006 budgetary
period. A large part of the envelope (€54 billion) is designed to help
Member States to comply with EU environmental legislation. Improvement of water
and waste management alone accounts for €28 billion of the total. 
Romania and Bulgaria are investing the highest proportion of Cohesion Policy
funds on environment-related projects, at 45% and 42% of their allocation
respectively. These investments include hundreds of environmental major
projects, which also contribute to protecting and creating jobs in the EU. 
Fight against climate change
The EU has embraced ambitious objectives in the fight against climate change
– a 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions with a 20% share of
renewable energies in EU energy consumption by 2020. With €48 billion
targeted at measures aimed at achieving EU climate objectives and creating a low
carbon economy, the Cohesion Policy is making a considerable contribution to
these goals. This includes €23 billion for railways, €6
billion for clean urban transport, €4.8 billion for renewable energies and
€4.2 billion for energy efficiency. 
The Cohesion Policy is also helping to create new market openings for local
economies by enabling them to seize the opportunities created by the need to
tackle climate change as new potential sources of growth. Nearly half of the
Member States (Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary,
Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the UK) have integrated
indicators for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into their Cohesion
Policy programmes. France, for example, has developed a unique carbon evaluation
tool to monitor CO2 emissions produced by all projects funded with EU
support.
Promoting eco-innovation 
Promoting eco-innovation and new “green-collar” jobs, especially
in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), ranks high in the priorities for support
for the regions. The Cohesion Policy is contributing €3 billion to the
promotion of environmentally-friendly products and production processes in SMEs.
One of the clear aims of funding for research and innovation is to boost overall
investment in green technologies. The Lahti
Cleantech cluster in Finland is a good example of this type of support. The
Community's investment in (€1.5 million) in this project encouraged
innovation and development of environmental technologies by bringing together
small and large enterprises, educational organisations and regional authorities.
The results speak for themselves: 170 new jobs have been created, 20 new
clean-tech companies have set up in the Lahti region and the project has
attracted more than €30 million in total investment.
"Green-proofed" programmes
The 455 operational programmes at the heart of the Cohesion Policy are
"green-proofed": prior to approval by the European Commission, Member States
have to submit a strategic environmental assessment to ensure their programmes
respect EU environmental rules. An environmental impact assessment must also be
carried out for certain Community-financed schemes – e.g. major transport
projects.
A flexible policy to adapt to complex challenges
The environmental challenge does not respect borders. Cohesion Policy, with
its numerous cross-border, transnational and interregional programmes, can offer
an important platform for new types of cooperation. For instance, the EU
Baltic Sea Region Strategy is the first EU strategy designed at the level of
a "macro-region", involving neighbouring countries such as Russia. One of its
main objectives is to improve the environmental state of the Baltic Sea.
