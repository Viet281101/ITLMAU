Brussels, 20 April 2009Platform for dialogue: 'European Integration
Forum' and interactive 'European Web Site on Integration': two new tools to make
integration workToday the Commission launched two new tools for
integration of third country nationals living in the European Union: The
European Integration Forum, organised in cooperation with the European Economic
and Social Committee, where EU institutions, stakeholders and civil society
organisations will exchange views on integration issues. Furthermore, the
European Web Site on Integration, which will soon become 'Integration at your
fingertips' – providing high-quality content from across Europe and
building an online community of integration practitioners.
Vice President Barrot, in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security said: "
I believe that it is essential for the success of integration policies to put
our heads together This is why I am particularly pleased that today we bring
together all stakeholders and organisations active in the area of integration on
the occasion of the inaugural meeting of the European Integration Forum and the
launch of the European Web Site on Integration. The Forum is a 'physical'
platform for a dialogue on the current challenges and future priorities for
integration policies. The Web Site is a "virtual platform", an online toolkit
for all those engaging with migrants.  It is a truly interactive instrument
where good practices are shared, funding opportunities can be discovered and
project partners found.  The site will help build a new online community of all
those working on integration."
Mario Sepi, President of the European Economic and Social Committee, stated
that "The integration process has been a long process, marked at times by
delays, reluctance and vetoes, but one which has also seen substantial steps
forward. It is a two-way process based on the rights and responsibilities of
immigrants and their host society. That is why, we have continued to push for a
genuine participatory integration policy, not least since our ongoing dialogue
with civil society has made clear its huge expectations in this regard. It is no
coincidence that all our opinions have remained free of the foul stench of
xenophobia; our Programme for Europe: Proposals of Civil Society is a clear
demonstration of this".
European Integration Forum: a platform for dialogue on integration
The European Integration Forum will provide an opportunity for
representatives of civil society organisations to express their views on
integration issues, in particular relating to the "EU agenda on integration". At
the same time, the Forum will allow the European Institutions to take a
pro-active role in this field. As a new platform for dialogue on integration,
organised in cooperation with the European Economic and Social Committee, the
Forum is an important occasion to discuss together with representatives of the
European institutions current challenges and future priorities. 
In today's inaugural meeting, the role and methods of the Forum in
contributing to the development of the future EU agenda for Integration, as well
as relevant topical issues, such as the consequences of the current economic
crisis on the integration of immigrants, will be addressed. The Forum will be
attended by civil society organisations dealing with integration at European
level, including social partners, as well as by European institutions. National
platforms on integration will also be present, together with representatives of
the network of National Contact Points on Integration.
The European Web Site on Integration: Integration at your
fingertips
The Forum is also the occasion for officially launching the European Web Site
on Integration (www.integration.eu).
The European Web Site on Integration aims at fostering integration policies
and practices by sharing successful strategies and supporting cooperation among
stakeholders and civil society organisations across the EU. It is open to
everyone and enables visitors to share good practices, to discover funding
opportunities and to look for project partners, to stay updated on the latest
developments at EU, national and local level and to stay in touch with members
of the EU integration community. By acting as a bridge between integration
practitioners and policy-makers, the European Web Site on Integration will soon
become 'Integration at your fingertips' – providing high-quality content
from across Europe and fostering the community of integration practitioners.
