Brussels, 7 May 2009The Southern Corridor: EU and partner
countries commit to move forwardThe European Commission and
the Czech Presidency of the EU will tomorrow host a Summit in Prague with
partner third countries on the development of the Southern Corridor for energy
and transport. The President of the European Commission, José Manuel
Barroso, and the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mirek Topolánek will
meet with the leaders of partner countries from Central Asia, Southern Caucasus,
Mashreq and Middle East. The Summit participants will discuss concrete ways for
progressing on the development of the Southern Corridor for energy and
transport, in particular the supplies of natural gas to the EU along the
Corridor route. The Summit is the first time that potential partners in the
Southern Corridor meet at the highest level to discuss their shared interests,
and the summit declaration will provide the first formal commitments by
consumer, producer and transit states on the conditions necessary to make a
success of the Corridor. President Barroso will be accompanied by
Commissioner Piebalgs during the summit.
The President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso said:
“After four years of intensive dialogue with our energy partners from
Central Asia, Southern Caucasus, Mashreq and the Middle East, today we are
moving ahead with concrete commitments to make the Southern Corridor, including
the Trans-Caspian link a reality. This Summit provides a unique opportunity to
bring together all the key actors in the region to increase the European Union's
energy security, and to launch co operation that will benefit all concerned".The Summit is a joint event between the Czech Presidency and the European
Commission. The participating partner countries are Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia,
Iraq, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The summit is also
attended by the representatives of the Russian Federation, United States and
Ukraine as observers. The representatives of the international financial
institutions (EIB, EBRD and World Bank) will be also present.
The objective of the summit is to provide strong political support and
concrete commitments for the development of the Southern Corridor,
including the Trans-Caspian interconnection. This should include commitments by
energy producer, transit and consumer countries along the Corridor and would
facilitate the supplies of energy resources from the Caspian region and Middle
East to the EU. The Summit is equally addressing the transport-related
aspects of the Southern Corridor route.
The EU has recently embarked on an ambitious plan to enhance its energy
security. Within this strategy, the Southern Corridor plays an important
role as a major energy infrastructure initiative contributing to diversification
of energy sources and routes for EU supplies.
