IP/09/910 Brussels, 12 June 2009 Words raising awareness: EU journalist competition on discrimination and diversity 15% of Europeans believe they have been discriminated against – one good reason for the European Commission to launch for the sixth year running its “For Diversity. Against Discrimination.” journalist competition. The award is open to both print and online journalists. It showcases the talents of media professionals who, through their writing, contribute to a better understanding of the benefits of diversity and tackling discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age, sexual orientation, race or ethnic origin. This year's award includes a special category for articles focusing on the link between poverty and discrimination. "Discrimination represents a waste of talent and a denial of fundamental rights," said Vladimír Špidla, EU Commissioner for Equal Opportunities. "Now is not the moment to let up on our efforts to tackle this scourge. On the contrary, we need all of our human resources to overcome the crisis and put Europe's economy back on the right track. This award, now in its sixth year, helps to raise awareness of people's right to equal treatment while showcasing journalistic talent in Europe."  The competition is aimed at journalists in the EU who, through their work, contribute to a better understanding of the benefits of diversity and the fight against discrimination. It is part of the European Commission’s “For Diversity. Against Discrimination.” communication campaign which promotes diversity and better information about discrimination rights throughout Europe. The award is organised in partnership with the Association of European Journalists, European Youth Press, and the European Journalism Centre. Last year the joint winners came from Le Monde in France and Danish national daily, Jyllands-Posten. The recently published   Media4Diversity   study has cited the Journalist Award as a good practice example which demonstrates “the power of incentives from the policy-making community through initiatives – and parallel funding measures”. Articles published between 30 November 2008 and 31 August 2009 in either print or online media within the EU are eligible for the competition. Entries can be submitted on  http://journalistaward.stop-discrimination.info . At the end of the entry period, national juries will gather in all 27 EU Member States to select the winning articles. A European jury will then choose the three best articles and the overall European Journalist Award winner from the 27 national winners. The winner of the 1st prize will receive €4,500, the runner-up and the winner of the 3 rd prize €3,000 and €2,000 respectively. As in previous years, a special award will also be given. This year, ahead of the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, articles focusing on discrimination and poverty will be awarded. To be considered for this special award, the articles must focus either on how discrimination based on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation can lead to poverty or how poverty can lead to discrimination. The winner of the Special Award will be rewarded with €2,500.  The European Commission is determined to eradicate discrimination in all its guises. The Journalist Award is one of several EU initiatives to promote a change of attitudes and behaviour in pursuit of this important goa l.
