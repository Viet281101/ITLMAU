Brussels, 22 April 2009Fisheries: open debate on the future of the
European Common Fisheries PolicyToday, the European Commission adopted a Green
Paper on the future of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy. The paper analyses the
shortcomings of the current Policy and launches a broad public consultation on
how these shortcomings should be tackled. Fishermen and other interested parties
from the sector, but also scientists, civil society and interested citizens, are
invited to respond and have their say until 31 December 2009 on the future face
of European fisheries.  The consultation is the first step of the process which
should bring about a radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Joe Borg said: "We are asking
questions even on the fundamentals of the current policy and should leave no
stone unturned. We are not looking for just another reform. It is time to design
a modern, simple and sustainable system for managing fisheries in the EU, which
is able to last well into the 21st century."  
The purpose of the Green Paper adopted today is twofold: raise awareness of
the challenges faced by the sector in recent years; and elicit a public response
which can grow into a new, innovative and more consensual approach to fisheries
regulation. It raises questions such as: How can we ensure the long-term
sustainability and the viability of fisheries? How can overall fleet capacity be
adapted while addressing the social concerns faced by coastal communities? How
can a culture of compliance be further developed?  How best can the CFP
contribute to fisheries sustainability beyond EU waters?  
The Paper analyses all the facets of fisheries policy today and explains why
some problems persist despite the progress made since the reform of 2002. One of
the main problems is the depleted state of European fish stocks: 88% of stocks
are overfished (against a global average of 25%) and 30% are "outside safe
biological limits", i.e. they cannot reproduce at normal rate because the
parenting population is too depleted. Yet in many fisheries we keep fishing 2 or
3 times more than what fish stocks can sustain. This is mostly as a result of
fleet overcapacity. Such overcapacity is in fact economically inefficient
because not only does it deplete stocks but it also constantly drives the
industry's profits down. Solutions need to be found to restore the worst-off
stocks and at the same time guarantee that fish can continue to be a reliable
source of revenue for fishermen. 
Above and beyond overcapacity, the Paper identifies four other structural
shortcomings of the present approach:the lack of precise policy objectives, especially with regard to ecological
responsibility and integration with general maritime issues; 
a decision-making system that is too centralised and focused on short-term
solutions which more often than not undermine long-term sustainability; 
a framework that does not give sufficient responsibility to the industry;the absence of political will towards compliance with the fishing
limitations.These issues have to be considered in a context where
Europe imports two-thirds of its demand in fisheries products. 
The Commission is concerned that if a better environmental sustainability of
fishing is not achieved in the coming years, the consequence will be
impoverished seas and an economically unviable fishing industry. If however the
next reform projects the Common Fisheries Policy into the 21st
century, the benefits will not just be limited to fishermen or coastal
communities, but will also be shared by Europe's citizens. 
Although the Commission is only legally bound to review some parts of the CFP
by 2012, the prevailing situation, particularly as regards stocks and fleet
overcapacity, has convinced it of the need to launch the reform process already
now. The consultation launched today will close on 31 December 2009 and the
Commission will sum up its results in the first half of 2010. After further
consultation with stakeholders, the Commission will then prepare an impact
assessment report and develop a proposal for a new basic regulation. This could
then be presented to the European Parliament and Council early in 2011, with a
view for adoption in 2012.
