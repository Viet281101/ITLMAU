Brussels, 21 April 2009Less Favoured Areas: Commission intensifies
cooperation with national authorities to simplify and better target the
aidThe European Commission today adopted a
Communication paving the way for a new classification of agricultural areas with
natural handicaps. With the help of scientific experts, the Commission has
identified 8 soil and climate criteria as a basis for objectively and clearly
classifying such areas. However, before presenting a legislative proposal, the
Commission needs more data to assess their feasibility. Therefore, Member States
are asked to provide simulations using national data to show how the criteria
might work. The new classification system is likely to be in place in 2014;
meanwhile the current system remains in force. This review exercise does not
affect mountain areas (already classified based on objective common criteria) or
areas with specific handicaps (e.g. islands and coastal areas) which are
classified according to those specific handicaps.
"The delimitation of areas with natural handicaps for agriculture needs to be
rationalized and the aid better targeted. It is in the interest of farmers and
of all of us that these areas continue to be farmed so as to prevent
environmental damage", said Mariann Fischer Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture
and Rural Development. "The objective is not to reduce or to enlarge the less
favoured areas, but to set up a delimitation system which is clear and
transparent, while taking into account the peculiarities of an area as large and
diverse as the EU."
A simpler and transparent area delimitation
Across the EU there are currently over 100 very different national criteria
for judging whether an area can receive a less favoured area payment. This
diversity was spotlighted by the Court of Auditors as a possible source of
unequal treatment. With the help of scientific experts, the Commission has
identified 8 soil and climate
criteria[1] that may be a good
basis for objectively and clearly classifying such areas. 
However, the feasibility of a new delimitation based on these criteria needs
to be assessed on the basis of simulations carried out by Member States using
detailed national data. 
Improved targeting
In order to preserve landscapes, natural habitats and biodiversity, to
prevent forest fires and to improve water and soil management, it is crucial to
maintain sustainable farming systems in areas where climate and soil make this
difficult.
EU subsidies to preserve farming in such areas should be reserved for those
areas where natural handicaps are severe and affect farming. The way aid is
distributed to farms in these areas should also target farms most at risk
of land abandonment.
Intense cooperation 
More than 100 meetings took place between the Commission and the Member
States and 121 contributions were received following a public consultation
launched on 22 May 2008. They are summarized in the impact assessment
accompanying the Communication.
The Communication adopted today further involves EU institutions, regions and
groups interested in agricultural land-use in the analysis leading to a new area
delimitation.
Member States are further associated by performing simulations that will be
crucial for the preparation of the Commission proposal.
Limited scope
This review exercise does not affect mountain areas (already classified based
on objective common criteria) or areas with specific handicaps (e.g. islands and
coastal areas) which are classified according to those specific handicaps.
Next steps
National authorities should send their simulations to the Commission by 21
October 2009. The new classification system is likely to be in place in
2014.

rooting depth, soil chemical properties, soil moisture balance and slope.
