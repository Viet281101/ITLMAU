Brussels, 1st April 2009Antitrust:
Commissioner Kroes takes note of MasterCard's decision to cut cross-border
Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs) and to repeal recent scheme fee increasesEuropean Commissioner for
Competition Neelie Kroes has indicated that, on the basis of information
currently available, she sees no need to pursue MasterCard for non-compliance
with a 2007 Commission decision that MasterCard's cross-border multilateral
interchange fees (MIF) were in breach of EC Treaty rules on restrictive business
practices (see IP/07/1959
and MEMO/07/590).
Following the 2007 Decision, MasterCard provisionally repealed its cross-border
MIF on 12 June 2008 (see MEMO/08/397)
but increased its scheme fees from October 2008. MasterCard now has decided to
apply a new methodology to its MIF for cross-border transactions which will
result in a substantially reduced average weighted MIF level compared with that
found to be in breach of EU antitrust rules. Following the new methodology, the
maximum weighted average MIF per transaction will be reduced to 0.30% for
consumer credit cards and to 0.20% for consumer debit cards. Moreover,
MasterCard has agreed to withdraw as of July 2009 the increases of its scheme
fees imposed in October 2008. Finally, MasterCard has agreed to change its
system rules as of July 2009 in order to increase transparency and competition
in the payment cards market. Implementation of these changes will be closely
monitored in the coming months. 
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "I am satisfied that these
undertakings will not only improve the efficiency and transparency of the
MasterCard payment card scheme but also provide a fair share of the benefits to
consumers and retailers. The new methodology for calculating the MIF will help
to bring clarity for banks and retailers and also lead to a substantial
reduction in comparison to MasterCard's previous MIF. We will be monitoring
implementation closely in the coming months."
The Commission decided in December 2007 (see IP/07/1959
and MEMO/07/590)
that the MIF established by MasterCard for cross-border transactions made with
MasterCard and Maestro branded debit and consumer credit cards in the European
Economic Area (EEA), did not comply with EC Treaty rules on restrictive
business practices (Article 81). Nevertheless, the decision did not exclude the
possibility that a MIF might be compatible with EC antitrust rules if it had
positive effects on innovation and efficiency and allowed a fair share of these
benefits to be passed on to consumers. The Decision gave MasterCard six months
(until 21 June 2008) to adjust its behaviour to comply with the antitrust rules
with the possibility of imposing penalty payments for any delays in the
implementation of the Decision. 
On 12 June 2008 (see MEMO/08/397),
MasterCard provisionally repealed its cross-border MIF, while continuing to
engage in discussions on a methodology to determine MIFs where consumers and
retailers would enjoy a fair share of the benefits.
MasterCard undertakings
MasterCard has now given three undertakings:First, MasterCard will, as of July 2009, calculate the cross-border MIF
according to a methodology which ensures that MIFs reflect the transactional
benefits to merchants of accepting payment cards as opposed to cash. The
calculation of a MIF on the basis of this methodology will lead to a
substantially reduced maximum weighted average MIF level: 0.30% per transaction
for consumer credit cards and 0.20% per transaction for consumer debit cards.
For comparison, depending on the
card, MasterCard's cross-border MIFs ranged from 0.80% to 1.90%
in 2007. Maestro cross-border MIFs ranged from more than 0.40% to more
than 0.75%).
Second, MasterCard will, as of July 2009, repeal the scheme fee increases it
announced in October 2008 (see below).
Third, MasterCard will, as of July 2009, adopt certain measures enhancing
the transparency of its scheme which will allow consumers and merchants to make
better informed choices about the means of payment they use and accept. For
example, MasterCard's rules will be changed so that merchants are offered and
invoiced distinct rates according to the type of card that is used, i.e. they
will be offered so-called 'unblended' rates. In October 2008
MasterCard revised its acquirer pricing structure in the EEA, which included
increasing certain existing acquirer fees (charged by a payment card scheme, in
this case MasterCard, vis-à-vis its member banks in the framework of their
adherence to the scheme), introducing a new fee on acquirers, and repealing
certain acquirer fee waivers.  However, these fees will now be repealed. 
In view of the changes to be made by MasterCard to its MIFs, its agreement to
repeal the scheme fee increases and on the basis of the information currently
available about these markets, Commissioner Kroes does not intend to propose to
the Commission to pursue MasterCard either for non-compliance with the
Commission's 2007 decision, or for infringing the antitrust rules by increasing
its scheme fees or by reintroducing a cross-border MIF. 
As regards Visa's behaviour on the payment cards market, the Commission will
continue its antitrust investigation (see MEMO/08/170)
and will monitor the behaviour of other market players to ensure that
competition is effective in this market to the benefit of merchants and
consumers.
