Brussels, 4 March 2009Commission calls on EU leaders to stay
united against the crisis, move fast on financial market reform and show global
leadership at G20The European Commission is calling on EU leaders to
further step up coordinated European action to fight the economic crisis. In its
communication to the European Council summit on 19-20 March, the Commission sets
out proposals for building on the extensive support already being given to the
real economy and to employment. The Commission's communication unveils a
comprehensive reform of the financial system based on the de Larosière
report. It shows how a clear and united commitment to this ambitious programme
can pave the way for the EU to give a global lead at the G20 summit in London on
2 April.
Commission President José Manuel Barroso said: “The Spring
European Council must send a strong signal to citizens, businesses and the
world. Yes, there is a way out of this crisis. Yes, Europe has the unity, the
confidence and the determination to win this battle. We must forcefully
implement the agreed recovery plan in a coordinated way. We must use the single
market to the full. Today we are asking EU leaders to agree on a comprehensive
action plan. To do everything possible to protect our citizens from
unemployment. To clean up financial markets on the basis of the de
Larosière Report. And to pave the way for Europe to lead by example and by
persuasion as we approach the G20 summit in London."
The banking system
The Commission's communication begins with an overview of the measures taken
since autumn 2008 which have prevented the meltdown of the European banking
industry and thus prevented countless bankruptcies and job losses. It urges
Member States to act quickly to restore confidence and get bank lending flowing
again, in particular by implementing the guidance the Commission issued on 25
February on removing impaired assets from banks' balance sheets.
Financial regulation and supervision
The Commission endorses – and asks EU leaders to endorse – the
key principles set out by the de Larosière Group. The Commission calls for
a supervisory system combining much stronger oversight at EU level with
maintaining a clear role for national supervisors. It backs the Group's proposal
to set up an early warning body under ECB auspices to identify and tackle
systemic risks. The Commission supports the Group's recommendation for a core
set of regulatory standards throughout the EU. 
In April the Commission will bring forward initiatives already in the
pipeline on hedge funds, private equity and remuneration structures. Following
an impact assessment, the Commission will put forward to the June European
Council a detailed timetable for further measures based on the de Larosière
report. It will bring forward proposals in the autumn on the new supervisory
framework and on issues including: liquidity risk and excessive leverage;
further reinforcing protection for depositors and policy holders; and effective
sanctions against wrongdoing. 
The real economy
The communication points to good first results of the European Economic
Recovery Plan. The overall fiscal support to the economy from European and
national measures and from automatic stabilisers amounts to at least 3.3% of GDP
over the 2009-2010 period. An annexe summarises 500 national measures and
concludes that they are broadly in line with the principles that recovery action
should be timely, targeted and temporary. 
The Commission calls on EU leaders to endorse clear principles for further
action, in line with the single market, with open trade worldwide, with building
a low carbon economy and with returning to sustainable public finances as soon
as possible.
The Commission repeats its call for Member States to agree on the targeted
investment of €5 billion euros in energy interconnections and
broadband.
Employment
The Commission's contribution calls for Member States to step up efforts to
tackle unemployment – which could approach 10% in 2010 for the first time
since the 1990s - and social exclusion. These efforts will also help maintain
demand and prevent further job losses. They should be a central plank of
national stimulus plans. The Commission invites Member States to use measures
such as financial support for temporary working-time arrangements, boosting
income support for unemployed people, lowering non-wage costs for employers and
boosting investment in skills and retraining. At European level the Commission
calls for rapid approval of its proposal to allow an immediate increase of
€1.8 billion in advance payments under the European Social Fund.
The Commission also sets out a road map towards the European Employment
Summit in Prague in May, which should agree on further concrete measures to save
jobs and create them in the sectors of the future. The Commission will organise
a series of workshops with all key stakeholders in different Member States in
the approach to the summit.
Promoting global recovery – how the EU should lead
The Commission asks EU leaders to agree on a number of areas where Europe can
and should give a firm lead on 2 April at the London G20 summit, building on the
success it achieved by speaking with one voice at the Washington Summit in
November 2008. 
The EU should make a united push to improve the global financial and
regulatory system, focusing on: better transparency and accountability;
appropriate regulation of all financial actors; tackling difficulties caused by
uncooperative jurisdictions; boosting international supervisory cooperation; and
reforming the IMF, Financial Stability Forum and World Bank. 
Europe should also promote global recovery by calling for a review of the
global impact of fiscal measures taken so far, by promoting open trade and by
inviting the London Summit to launch a multilateral initiative on trade finance
and to reaffirm the Washington commitment to the Millennium Development Goals.The full text of the Commission's communication to the European Council will
