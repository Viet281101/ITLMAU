Brussels, January 30 2009Second EU translation contest winners
announcedA new vintage of ‘young translators’
will be invited to Brussels in April to receive a prize for the best translation
from the European Commissioner for Multilingualism, Mr Leonard Orban. The names
of the 27 winners of the ‘Juvenes Translatores’ contest held by the
European Commission are published today on the website http://ec.europa.eu/translation/contest/index_en.htm
together with the winning translations. 
"I’m pleased to see that schools across Europe have embraced the
contest so enthusiastically", commented Mr Orban. "The contest provides a true
challenge in testing the language skills learned at school. At the same time,
students get a foretaste of what it is like to work as a translator".
Mr Orban’s impressions are confirmed by the increased participation and
the results of an online survey sent to teachers in the schools picked to take
part. Practically all of the teachers surveyed (99%) would enter their school
again, while 86% found the length and level of the texts to be appropriate, a
view that is borne out by the high quality of the translations. 
The entries to the ‘Juvenes Translatores’ contest (‘young
translators’ in Latin) were marked by a panel of professional translators
and revisers from the European Commission’s Directorate-General for
Translation (DGT). They were impressed by the high standard — 10% of the
pupils obtained a mark in the top range of the scale. 
Each anonymous translation was marked by a native speaker of the language
into which the text was translated. A board chaired by the Director-General of
DGT then picked out the best translation from each Member State.
The 27 winners from European upper secondary schools will win a three-day
trip to Brussels for themselves and for one accompanying adult to receive a
prize and a certificate at a special award ceremony on 3 April. 
They were among 2247 pupils from 593 schools in the EU taking part in the
second edition of the translation contest which was held on 27 November 2008 at
the same time in all Member States and supervised by the schools. Entrants were
given two hours to translate a text on the topic of multilingualism from one of
the 23 official languages of the EU into another official language of their
choice. The Commission received translations covering all official languages and
147 language combinations.
